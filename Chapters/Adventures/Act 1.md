### Act 1: Distress in the Void

#### Scene 1: A Sudden Detour

As the runabout Dragonfly slices through the star-studded expanse of space, bound for the enchanting world of Arkenhold, the serene journey is abruptly interrupted by a faint but insistent distress signal, originating from Tarnis IV, a moon notorious for its treacherous terrain and unpredictable weather patterns. The crew, comprising Second Officer Lyrissa, Chief Tactical Officer K'vatch, and the greenhorn Ensign Atlanta, faces their first test. Lyrissa, taking command, decides to investigate, demonstrating the Planetary Alliance's unwavering commitment to aiding those in peril.

**Challenge:** The crew must successfully navigate the Dragonfly through the gravitational anomalies surrounding Tarnis IV to land near the crash site. This requires a series of skill checks: a Dexterity check for piloting through the gravitational flux, an Intelligence check to calculate the safest landing trajectory, and a Wisdom check to intuit the best time to make their descent.

#### Scene 2: The Harsh Welcome of Tarnis IV

Tarnis IV greets the Dragonfly with howling winds and a horizon obscured by swirling dust. The adventurers, equipped for both survival and rescue, disembark. K'vatch, with his tactical mind, suggests a formation to protect Atlanta, who carries the medical kit, essential for stabilizing any survivors they find. Their path is fraught with danger; every step must be measured, every decision weighed with care.

**Challenge:** The adventurers must navigate the treacherous valley leading to the crash site. Athletics checks are required to traverse the jagged, unstable ground without injury. Survival checks help them find the quickest, safest route through the obscured terrain. Along the way, a sudden rockslide (triggered by a failed check or a predetermined event) tests their reflexes with Dexterity saving throws to avoid injury or becoming trapped.

#### Scene 3: Echoes of Calamity

As they approach the crash site, the scale of the disaster becomes apparent. The freighter, a twisted hulk of metal, lies scattered across the valley. Amidst the debris, faint sounds of life stirâ€”survivors. The adventurers' arrival sparks hope amidst despair. The survivors, a mix of crew members and a mysterious passenger, are in dire straits, injuries varying from minor to critical.

**Challenge:** The adventurers must quickly assess the survivors' conditions and prioritize medical treatment. Medicine checks determine the severity of the injuries and the best way to stabilize the survivors with the limited supplies on hand. Persuasion checks are needed to calm the survivors, some of whom are on the brink of panic, assuring them that rescue has come. A special Insight check may reveal that the mysterious passenger is hiding something, a secret that could add depth to the narrative.

#### Scene 4: Shadows Stir

As the adventurers work to stabilize the survivors, a low rumble disturbs the eerie silence of the valley. A dust storm is brewing, fast approaching. Time is of the essence. K'vatch, with a nod from Lyrissa, begins to prepare a makeshift shelter from the wreckage to shield them from the storm. Meanwhile, Atlanta, her nerves steadied by the urgency of the situation, tends to the wounded with a newfound determination.

**Challenge:** The adventurers face a race against time to create a shelter before the dust storm hits. This requires a combination of Strength checks to move debris and Intelligence checks to engineer a protective barrier. Cooperation is key, as is quick thinking. The storm itself presents a final challenge for this act, with Constitution saving throws required to withstand the choking dust and howling winds without succumbing to exhaustion or injury.

#### Act 1 Conclusion: Shelter Amidst the Storm

As the storm rages outside, the adventurers and survivors huddle within the fragile sanctuary of their makeshift shelter. Bonds are formed in the crucible of shared adversity; stories are exchanged, and the mysterious passenger's secret becomes a tantalizing thread for the adventurers to unravel. In the eye of the storm, both literal and metaphorical, the crew of the Dragonfly finds strength in unity, ready to face whatever challenges Tarnis IV has yet to reveal.

As the winds die down, the adventurers prepare for the next phase of their mission: the journey back to the Dragonfly with the survivors in tow, and the unraveling of the mysterious passenger's secret. The adventure on Tarnis IV is far from over, but the crew has proven their mettle.
