## ACT 1: Into the Darkness

### Captain’s StarLog 2499.932. 
We are responding to a distress call from a Elven Expeditionary Group on Trax Epsilon I. We lost the signal one day ago, but are still en route. The distress call read: “We require immediate assistance, atmospheric conditions have proven too hazardous to the expedition to continue. One team lost, their coordinates are enclosed. Two members of the expedition remain here at base camp T’Vral. We request the nearest Alliance vessel make contact and extract us. Message repeats.

### THE STATE OF THE PLANET 
The atmosphere is now composed of a thick silicate gas. The silicon ions, having bonded with oxygen, has rendered the air unbreathable so environment (EV) suits must be worn. Not only that, at a quantum level these silicate ions absorb light waves, which means all but 0.04% of light that hits the planet from its parent star is absorbed. Without this, the planet has reduced in temperature significantly over the course of several days, and without an EV suit people on the surface would have to endure subzero temperatures

### SCENE 1: THE DISTRESS CALL 
Once the captain’s log has been read or paraphrased as an introduction, the Players’ vessel enters the Trax Epsilon system. From here the Players can make initial scans of the planet either from the edge of the system, or from orbit (either way the result will be the same). A Operational + Intelligence Task with a Difficulty of 10, will reveal the first planet in the system is displaying strange, yet unseen characteristics: the planet is covered in a black atmosphere, reflecting all but 0.04% of light. The viewer shows an incredible sight against its bright blue-white sun, a dark void in the center of the viewscreen. The sensors don’t detect much else, and nothing of the planet’s surface upon which the Elven team had their outpost. The planet’s magnetic field is also anomalous – its poles moving and fluctuating, causing interference to sensors and communications. Heroism spent to Obtain Information may reveal its current atmospheric composition as predominantly a silicate molecule. Any further questions from Obtain Information Heroism spends will need further analysis, but the Gamemaster can give basic information, covering Traits and any other information from the sections below.

#### TRAX EPSILON I 
Trax Epsilon I, in the Kepler sector, is registered by longrange probes as a Class-H planet, marginally habitable, with arid conditions and very little surface water. The Elven Expeditionary Group came here to study the planet’s atmosphere, as they’d never encountered a Class-H atmosphere so close to its sun – just 0.03 AUs away. Since they landed, the planet has undergone an incredible transformation into the hellish, light-absorbing globe on the viewscreen. 

On the surface, Players will find these incredibly difficult conditions:

Situation Traits:

- Darkness 2 – The atmosphere of the planet absorbs almost all light, and some of the infrared and ultraviolet spectrum. This Trait is enough to render all visual perception beyond about 1-2 meters impossible. It also increases all Tasks that involve visual detection within two meters by 10. 
- Geomagnetic Anomalies – The magnetic field of the planet is in a state of flux. Any Tasks to scan the planet, or scans while on the surface, are increased in Difficulty by 1 step.
- Hostile Atmosphere – The planet’s atmosphere has undergone a huge change in chemical composition, rendering it unbreathable and very cold. Any humanoid that breathes a Class-M atmosphere exposed to this atmosphere begins to Suffocate (see Suffocation), or if left without thermal insulation may freeze to death they start taking 1 level of Exhaustion a round from the cold unless they have resistance.

> #### SUFFOCATION
> A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).
> When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.
> For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points. 

#### LOCATING THE OUTPOST 
A Technical + Mental Task with a Difficulty of 15 should allow anyone to find the Elven Expeditionary Group’s research outpost, using library records of their landing site compared with current telemetry. Player Characters can use a shuttle to travel to the surface. Travelling down by shuttle will introduce the scene below. The characters will need to wear EV suits, which normally have an Opportunity cost of ehich are standard issue for this adventure because they could not operate without them.

##### EV Suit
- EV suit. This bulky outfit is often used whenever walking into zones deemed to be biohazards. The suit has a built in air filtration unit and is chemically sealed. While wearing this suit, you are immune to poison and disease, however, your movement rate is halved and you cannot take reactions. Lasts 4 hours

####  SCENE: A SHUTTLE RIDE 
Players wishing to take a shuttle to the surface will need to succeed with a Operational + Dexterity Task with a Difficulty of 20. Spend Threat to increase the Difficulty based on the incredibly limited visibility, but let the Players Succeed at Cost of a Complication, which can be the shuttle crashing or a System on the shuttle being disabled before landing. 

> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ELVES? 
> The two deceased Elven scientists are the two members of their team who lasted the longest. Unfortunately, they (like the rest of their group) were attacked by the Krilian Pods, hungry creatures looking for electrical power to feed upon. Menos and V’Lar had not heard from the rest of their team for three days, and when the thick black atmosphere rolled in they decided to send the distress call. As soon as they did the creatures attacked. As their prefab buildings were breached, life-support failed and they quickly made their way to an access panel and put on their EV suits. They made some attempt to defend themselves, with Phase pistols, but were clearly unsuccessful. They were ripped from their prefab buildings, and picked off by the huge creatures. An important distinction to make is about the EV suits that are the most damaged, with only mild blunt force trauma suffered by Elven due to impacts from the pod creatures. The Krilian Pods effectively sucked the power from their suits, while the smashed visors depressurised the suit and exposed the Elven to the hostile atmosphere.

### SCENE 2: THE OUTPOST 
When the away team arrives at the Elven base camp, EV suits on, they discover a darkness the likes of which they’ve never experienced. The only light produced is from their own head lamps, and even that light only extends a meter wherever they go. Operating on an away mission with an EV suit increases the Difficulty of all Physical or Sight Tasks by 10, due to the suit’s restrictions. The Geomagnetic Anomalies also increase the Difficulty of hailing the ship, or each other at a distance, by 1. You may want to allow the characters to Succeed at Cost when trying to communicate with their ship, with a Complication limiting what kind of information they can get across due to the interference or being cut off. Read or paraphrase the following:

> *Stumbling across the arid ground, your EV lights barely illuminating a meter in front of you, you finally find walls, cabling, and closed hatches. The Elven outpost lies abandoned, void of power. Prefab buildings have been torn up, with breaches and tears all along their alloy-plated sides. None of the doors open, and with no emergency power, will take some effort to open manually. The consoles lie dead and tricorder scans show that not even life-support functions inside the buildings.*

Let the Player Characters investigate the prefabs, emphasising the difficulty they are having in their EV suits and the sheer darkness all around them. If you think any investigation is particularly difficult, ask for a Task with an increased Difficulty due to the location Traits. Any Complications from Tasks here, or a particularly evil Threat spend, could start a psychological episode in a character because of the darkness.

They find the following: 
- No members of the Elven expedition are present in  the prefabs. 
- All power has been drained from the outpost, even emergency power and batteries. If the Players want to get power back online, they will need to complete Key Tasks of the Challenge below. 
- All the Elven EV suits are gone from their locker
- Outside, two Elven scientists lie dead, with smashed EV suits. Power has been drained from the EV suits too.

An investigation of the dead Elven expedition members (an Observational + Intelligence Task with a Difficulty of 15, 10 with a scanner) will confirm they are dead, their bodies frozen inside their non-functioning EV suits. Their likenesses register as two scientists of the Elven Expeditionary Group; two confirmed deaths (Menos and V’Lar). Any Obtain Information Momentum spends could reveal the following: 

- The Elven themselves died of asphyxiation, not wounds or blunt force trauma. 
- The suits breaches expose key power points, cabling, and batteries. 

If the Players want to get the base camp up and running again, they’re going to need a new power supply, and complete the first Key Tasks of the Challenge: 
- Acquire a new power supply: This can be accomplished through jury-rigging or engineering improvisation, or by communicating with their ship.  A Task should be required for any option. 
- Get power back online: The electro-plasma system overloaded due to a massive unregulated transfer of power, and the team needs to integrate their solution with the Elven prefabs. This is a Dexterity + Engineering Task with a Difficulty of 20, due to the  EV suits and the Darkness. Any Focus in Power Systems would apply here, particularly Electro-Plasma Power Systems.
- Recover computer systems: (Locked) Once the power is back online the crew can attempt to recover computer functionality. This is a Technical + Intelligence Task with a Difficulty of 15. A Focus in Computers applies.

Once certain Key Tasks have been completed, the characters can attempt the following Tasks around the base camp:
- Research the logs: (Locked) Once the computer system has been recovered, the away team can research the logs of the expedition group. This is an Operational + Intelligence Task with a Difficulty of 5. You can either read the log to the Players without asking for a roll, or let them roll, read the log, and let them spend the Momentum they gain to ask questions using Obtain Information.
- Re-establish Life Support: (Locked) Once the power systems are back online, the away team can try to reestablish life support to the prefabs. This is a Engineering + Dexterity Task with a Difficulty of 25 and requires 4 total successes. Anyone assisting this Task cannot help with other unlocked Tasks, depending on how you are managing the group’s time.

The away team can recover the locations of several impact craters all around the planet, recorded by the Elven sensors, the nearest being about 1,000 km away. These serve as points of interest in the following act for Players to investigate.


#### THE EXPEDITION LOGS
Menos’ logs are matter of fact, even dull in places, but the following excerpts are the most pertinent.

“Starlog 2443.7 (47197.4.) Establishing base camp we have deduced the planet’s semi-major axis as 0.03556 AU, orbital eccentricity of 0.0018, Orbital period of 2.47063 days, a rotational period of 6.125 hours, and an orbital inclination of 83.57. The day/night period will take some adjustment.”

“Starlog 2494.4 (47248.1). This morning, several unidentified objects fell and impacted the surface of the planet, producing substantial shockwaves, which has impaired some of our equipment – most notably sensors. While first thought of as large meteorites, scans detect life signs, and as such an exploratory team has been selected to investigate the phenomena. The nearest impact sight is a day’s travel by desert flyer... I have not been selected.”

“Starlog 2496.2 (47249.9). We have not heard from the exploratory team today. We will attempt to reestablish communications  by transmitting every 3 hours, with the standard call and response procedure.”

“Starlog 2496.8 (47250.5). A storm has begun to move in on our position – an intensely thick, black storm. The sensors are measuring sudden electrostatic discharges from its strange composition. This weather was not detected in orbit by initial surveys, so I must continue to try and gain telemetry – though as noted in my previous log, the sensor equipment has been functioning at 37.51% efficiency since the impacts.”

“Starlog 2498.3 (47251.7). The atmospheric phenomenon is all around us now, having entirely replaced the composition of the Class-H atmosphere of the planet previously. No contact has been made with the exploratory team and I am uncertain our communications have been penetrating the atmospheric phenomenon. We have decided to activate a distress call to alert Starfleet to our situation.”

A supplementary log follows the final log, with the strained voice of Menos: “Expedition log, supplemental – we are under attack from an unknown alien species. They have inflicted breaches to the structure of the buildings and main power is offline. Environmental controls are failing, I have ordered V’Lar to prepare the EV suits.” A pause is followed by phaser f ire and an alien scream, as well as the sounds of an EV suit pressurising. “This log will be our last here. We will –” Menos’ voice cuts out with a crash, and an incredibly uncomfortable pause follows, with the muffled sounds of crunches and alien screams before the computer closes the log.

## ACT 2: FOLLOWING THE FIELDS

### SCENE 1: INVESTIGATING THE PLANET
Either in orbit or at base camp, science and engineering characters might be working to cut through the thick atmospheric interference, and investigate the phenomenon, guided by the Scientific Method.

#### WHAT IS THIS ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENON? THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD 
The Scientific Method is outlined here, made relevant to this mission.

#### STEP 1: OBSERVE 
Since the characters have observed the anomalous atmosphere in the previous act, they can know immediately the lead Discipline is Science. Characters with a high Science Discipline should become the Research Lead, with others assisting if they feel they can have a positive influence on progress.

#### STEP 2: HYPOTHESIZE 
Ask the Players to choose 3 to 5 Focuses that might apply to the phenomenon, as Hypotheses of why the atmosphere has changed so dramatically. They don’t need to possess the Focus, and can choose freely. The correct Focus, or “The Right Way” is Terraforming, but do not inform the Players. If none of the Hypotheses put forward fit the problem, immediately gain 1 point of Threat and tell the Players to start this step again. Players don’t need to be precise; if they’re reasonably close with suggestions like Alien Technology or Climate Change, Step 3 can proceed and they can be informed on how they can refine their thinking.

#### STEP 3: TEST 
Investigating the phenomenon is the ‘testing’ involved with this particular scientific method, accompanied by an Extended Task. As the group uses the computer to simulate their Hypothesis and compare the result with the readings of the atmosphere, each Breakthrough they achieve will give them more information about the phenomenon. It’s important that these Breakthroughs are interesting to the Players if there isn’t a deadline or some jeopardy alongside its completion. If you are managing two separate groups of characters, let those testing their theory attempt one Task before moving back to the away team for part of a scene. If the away team is investigating from base camp, or if all characters are aboard their ship, then continue this Extended Task until it is completed. 

EXTENDED TASK 
- Work Track: 20 
- Magnitude: 4 
- Difficulty: 20 (3)
- Resistance: 2
- Test: Decided in Step 2
- Interval: 15 minutes

##### Astra Genesis Extended Test Rules
Extended tests in Astra Genesis have several components.

- Work Force: 5-20
- Magnitude: 1-5
- Difficulty: 5-25
- Resistance: 0-3
- Test: The skill test required
- Interval: How long each test takes

The testing character makes their test if they are successful they roll Xd2 where X is the number of ranks in the relevant skill. Total the D2 (called challenge dice) together and subtract the resistance if there is any. Anything left over is applied directly to the Work Force. For every 5 work force applied; you get 1 Progress. When the Progress equals the Magnitude the test is successful. These should be used somewhat sparingly but they can add drama to certain scenes. Resistance represents difficulties like working under stress, lack of proper tools etc.

With a Magnitude of 4, the Players need 4 Progress in their research to effectively recalibrate the sensors and communications systems to provide them with an Advantage to cancel out the Geomagnetic Anomalies Trait.

##### Breakthrough 1 
Shows the researchers the atmospheric composition is now dominated by a rare silicate gas. It has never been recorded naturally, and was not present on the planet during initial scans. This Breakthrough also informs the Players that Terraforming is the Right Way, or that they need to refine their thinking if the Focus they have picked is a stretch. As with all Extended Tasks, reduce the Difficulty of further Tasks by 1 for each Breakthrough. 

##### Breakthrough 2 
Proves there is a link between the Geomagnetic Anomalies and the Darkness of the silicon substance in the atmosphere. It seems the silicate acts as a kind of catalyst for the fluctuations in the magnetic field, though it is unclear why the fluctuations are occurring. It also shows them that the gas is concentrated at several sites around the planet (but leave the Players to link this observation with the impact sites in the Elven logs).

##### Breakthrough 3 
Shows the characters that, at the quantum level, the silicate gas absorbs the visible light spectrum, and is affecting subspace communications down to the planet in the same way. This invites the Players to apply more of their Focuses to their Task rolls, such as Quantum Mechanics. 

##### Breakthrough 4 
Maps the shifting magnetic poles and electrostatic energy in the atmosphere to a degree that the sensors and communications can be easily calibrated to compensate. This provides the Players with an Advantage Geomagnetic Mapping that cancels any Difficulty increase to Sensors Tasks due to the Darkness or Geomagnetic Anomalies Traits.

---

Any Complications, here can increase the Difficulty of Tasks or the Resistance of the Extended Task if the characters are not making the right assumptions from the information gathered, but be careful to provide rewarding obstacles to their research rather than just blocking their progress.

#### FURTHER SCANS 
With the sensors now calibrated, the Players may now try to get more information on the planet overall, or focus their attention on particular areas of the planet. Here’s what they can ultimately find out, but consider pacing these discoveries with the away team’s progress:

- Several fresh impact craters dot the surface all over the planet, about 100 in all. Obtain Information Momentum spends can reveal more (see Scene 2: Looking for the Exploration Team). 
- Large life-forms can be detected across the planet. Five meters across and twice as long (Scale 1), these creatures are flying with long tentacle-like tendrils. 
- The remaining Elven expedition bodies can be found by searching for the specific EV suit materials or Elven DNA, but as they are dead, no life-signs can be found. This is a Operational + Mental Task with a Difficulty of 4 (TN 25) due to its specificity. Success can pinpoint the team’s location at a crater 1,000km from the Vulcan base camp (see Scene 2: Looking for the Exploration Team).
