### Adventure Module: Echoes of Tarnis IV

#### Background

The adventurers, aboard the runabout Dragonfly, are en route to the mystic world of Arkenhold when a distress signal from Tarnis IV, a nearby moon, interrupts their journey. The signal originates from a crashed freighter, and survivors are in desperate need of rescue. Tarnis IV, known for its harsh terrain and environmental hazards, promises to challenge the adventurers as they embark on this unexpected rescue mission.

#### Adventure Hook

While Second Officer Lyrissa, Chief Tactical Officer K'vatch, and Ensign Atlanta navigate through space, the Dragonfly’s sensors catch a faint distress signal. The source: Tarnis IV. Lyrissa, feeling the weight of her responsibility, decides to investigate. K'vatch, with his tactical acumen, prepares for any hostility, while Atlanta, eager yet inexperienced, readies the medical kit. The adventurers must now balance the urgency of their original mission with the immediate need to save lives.

#### Key Locations

1. **The Dragonfly:** The adventurers' runabout, equipped with advanced navigation and survival gear, but not designed for intense combat.
   
2. **Crash Site on Tarnis IV:** A valley of jagged rocks and metallic debris, where the freighter's remains are scattered. The site is prone to sudden rockslides and hazardous dust storms.

3. **Survivor Camp:** Within the wreckage, a makeshift shelter where the survivors are found, injured and shaken, but alive.

#### Objectives

1. **Navigate to Tarnis IV:** Successfully pilot the Dragonfly through the moon’s erratic gravitational fields and land near the crash site.
   
2. **Rescue the Survivors:** Locate the survivors within the wreckage, provide first aid, and prepare them for evacuation.

3. **Return Safely:** Navigate back to the Dragonfly with the survivors, avoiding or overcoming environmental hazards and any unexpected threats.

#### Challenges

1. **Hazardous Terrain:** The adventurers must make skill checks to navigate the treacherous terrain of Tarnis IV without injury. Failure could result in delays or additional injuries.
   
2. **Environmental Hazards:** Dust storms can reduce visibility to near zero, requiring successful survival checks to find shelter or proceed without becoming lost.

3. **Survivor Morale:** The survivors are on the brink of despair. Persuasion checks may be needed to calm them and convince them that rescue is at hand.

4. **Limited Resources:** The adventurers have a finite amount of medical supplies and must decide how best to use them to stabilize the survivors.

#### NPCs

1. **Chief Tactical Officer K'vatch:** A seasoned officer with knowledge of survival tactics. He offers advice and assists in defending the party if needed.

2. **Ensign Atlanta:** A young officer, skilled in first aid. She can provide healing but may need encouragement to overcome the overwhelming situation.

3. **Survivors:** A group of freighter crew members with varying injuries. Among them is a secretive passenger with knowledge of an ancient artifact, adding a twist to the adventure.

#### Rewards

1. **Alliance Commendations:** Successful rescue and completion of the mission earn the adventurers commendations from the Planetary Alliance, opening doors to future missions and rewards.

2. **Ancient Artifact:** If the adventurers gain the trust of the secretive passenger, they learn the location of an ancient artifact on Arkenhold, setting the stage for their next adventure.

3. **Experience and Growth:** Beyond material rewards, the adventurers gain invaluable experience in crisis management, team leadership, and survival skills.

#### Adventure Conclusion

With the survivors safely aboard the Dragonfly, the adventurers set course for the nearest medical facility. The mission to Tarnis IV, though unexpected, has tested their resolve, teamwork, and compassion. As they continue their journey to Arkenhold, they do so with the satisfaction of lives saved and lessons learned, ready for whatever the galaxy throws their way next.
