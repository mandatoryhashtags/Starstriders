# Starships
> Game Designer Note
> A Starship can arguably be said to be the real hero of the game in some sense. Starships in Astra Genesis are treated like a sort of character. In Combat and Skill based scenarios the ship is able to help players. The players are sitting in a ship that can take one hell of a beating as a rule. These combat rules later on are intended to match the feel of a Narrative, film based space combat fight. Where a ship gets the crap beat out of it but still makes it out. The Wrath of Khan is a great example, several times in Star Wars as well shows this type of thing including in the Mandalorian. That is what this is trying to capture. I am not trying to create a realisitic battle simulator for space combat where a rail dart flies through the ship and rips it apart like the Expanse. You can mimic more of that by removing shields.

Operating a Starship is not massively dissimilar to the way characters act and interact normally. The normal rules for Tasks, Obstacles, and Challenges still apply to a character aboard a starship, and many of the activities a character engages in aboard ship will be resolved in the same ways that they would be on the surface of a strange new world. A crucial concept for starship operations is the difference between actions taken aboard a starship, and actions taken with a starship.

Actions taken aboard a starship are no different to actions taken anywhere else. In this context, a starship is essentially just a location within which the action is taking place, rather than an active element of that action. That is not to say that there aren’t Advantages to acting aboard ship: the tools and resources available to the crew of a starship can provide a significant benefit that they wouldn’t have elsewhere. For actions taken aboard a ship, there are no innate or inherent Advantages, though there may still be benefits depending on where aboard the ship the actions are attempted, and what facilities the ship itself offers. These will be discussed in more detail later.

Actions taken with a starship always benefit from the ship’s presence and nature, because the ship is how the actions are taken. These activities are invariably the use of control systems within the ship to make the ship itself do something, such as moving between planets, firing torpedoes, scanning celestial phenomena, and other actions that are performed with the ship’s systems directly. These actions normally influence something external to the ship, rather than upon something inside it.

## STARSHIP PROFILES
Just as with characters, starships are represented using several attributes, skills, traits, talents, and so forth. Starships, however, use these numbers and rules to reflect different things than they might represent on characters.

### TRAITS
A starship will typically have one or more Traits, one of which will always be the name of the civilization which created it. Traits are essentially descriptions of important aspects of the ship’s fundamental nature and function, in a single word or a short phrase. Traits help define what the ship is and what it can do, and they can be employed in the same way as Traits for a location or situation, such as to increase or reduce the Difficulty of Tasks.

First and foremost, we have the ship’s origin. Different cultures in Astra Genesis manufacture their ships in myriad different ways, and a Trait can encapsulate those many little differences easily. These are both positive and negative, and influence both how the ship interacts with its environment, but also how characters and other ships interact with it. A ship may have additional Traits reflecting other definitive elements of its construction or purpose, or even the influence of past events.

Traits are neutral, and thus able to be applied both positively and negatively. There is no fixed number of Traits a ship will have, though every vessel will have at least one. Traits and their affect on game play are in the New Rules.

### SYSTEMS
Each starship in Astra Genesis is defined by six Systems, which work in a similar manner to a character’s Attributes. They embody the intrinsic capabilities of the ship, compared to other vessels, and the ways in which those capabilities are best employed. These Systems are Communications, Computers, Engines, Sensors, Structure, and Weapons. Each System has a rating which determines its measure, with higher numbers reflecting greater utility.

Characters may encounter situations in which more than one of their ship’s Systems are applicable. In these cases, it is important to consider the context of the situation, and how the character is choosing to approach the problem. The Gamemaster may choose which System is most applicable to a situation if more than one could be used.

Systems all begin at 10, their Spaceframe will determine the final number. Starships get modifiers same as players do.

#### COMMUNICATIONS
This System encompasses the transmission, encryption, decryption, and retrieval of subspace signals on a range of frequencies, as well as a range of other forms of signals transmission and reception. Any Task that involves or relies upon communications systems should use Communications. A character might use a ship’s Communications...

- ...when attempting to clear up a signal distorted beyond all recognition, to determine its origin or content.
- ...when attempting to glean specific information from amongst an abundance of signals.
- ...when trying to generate interference to block or jam other signals.
- ...when trying to coordinate between many allied vessels during a crisis.

#### COMPUTERS
This System represents the ship’s library and operational computer systems, from the Duotronic systems of the 23rd century, to the Isolinear and Bioneural systems of the 24th century. Any Task that relies on the processing power and data storage of the ship’s computers uses Computers.

A character might use a ship’s Computers...

- ...when attempting to retrieve or research information stored within the ship’s library.
- ...when analyzing information gathered during an experiment or scan.
- ...when creating a simulation of a situation or effect to try to predict how it will unfold.
- ...when trying to remotely perform some complex activity using automation.

#### ENGINES
This System covers the propulsion and power generation systems of the vessel, and its ability to move and maneuver through space. This includes thrusters, impulse engines, and warp drive, as well as reactors, generators, and related systems such as the navigational deflector. Any Task that relies on moving the vessel under its own power uses Engines.

A character might use a ship’s Engines...

- ...when attempting to maneuver the ship.
- ...when trying to increase the ship’s power output.
- ...when trying to project a particle stream or form of energy from the navigational deflector.
- ...when attempting to pursue another vessel moving significantly faster.

#### SENSORS
This System covers the vessel’s sensor suites and probes, allowing it to scan and monitor its surroundings, and the scientific systems that interpret that data. It also relates to teleporters (exceedingly rare), as they are heavily tied into a ship’s sensors. Any Task that involves scanning and analysis using the vessel’s sensor arrays should use Sensors.

A character might use a ship’s Sensors...

- ...when attempting to gain information about an object or phenomenon using the ship’s sensors or a probe.
- ...when attempting to beam a creature or object to or from a location.
- ...when using internal analytical systems — such as those found in laboratories, or sickbay — to study an object or creature in depth.
- ...when attempting to locate an intruder or foreign force moving within the ship.

#### STRUCTURE
This System covers the physical construction of the vessel, from its hull and superstructure, to the structural integrity field and inertial dampeners, as well as thermal and radiation shielding, and all aspects of the ship’s basic operational infrastructure, including life support systems, and artificial gravity. Any Task that involves the physical construction of the vessel or its protective systems uses Structure.

A character might use the ship’s Structure...

- ...when attempting to reinforce the ship against an external threat or hazard.
- ...when altering life support to produce specific environmental conditions in a specific compartment or section.
- ...when engaged in activity where maintaining the ship’s integrity is vital.

#### WEAPONS
This System covers the tactical and offensive systems of the vessel, normally phasers or disruptors, plus torpedo launchers, and maybe even other weapons besides. Any Task that involves attacking a target use Weapons.

A character might use the ship’s Weapons...

- ...when attempting to fire on another vessel.
- ...when trying to cut or destroy an object or obstacle.
- ...when modifying a weapon system to produce an unusual or alternative effect.


### DEPARTMENTS
In addition to the six Systems, each ship is equipped to support six Departments, which encompass the various mission profiles, specialties, and personnel each ship carries. Each Department is rated from 0 to 5, with each rating representing variations of resource allocation, technology, and crew proficiency within that field. Alliance starships have at least a 1 in every Department — vessels are expected to fulfil a variety of roles and carry out a wide range of missions.

The six Departments mirror the six Disciplines possessed by characters — Command, Conn, Engineering, Security, Science, and Medicine — though they represent how much support those fields receive aboard the ship, as noted above. Each Department covers a wide range of activities, and some activities may fit under more than one Department, so which one is most applicable to any of those things will depend on circumstances more than anything else.

| DEPARTMENT | MEANING                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0          | No dedicated facility for this field; improvised capabilities only.                                         |
| 1          | Basic. minimum-level capabilities for this department — a small number of personnel and limited facilities. |
| 2          | Standard capabilities for this department — moderate facilities and a basic staff.                          |
| 3          | Improved capabilities for this department — large facilities and experienced personnel                      |
| 4          | Advanced capabilities for this department — expansive specialized facilities and excellent personnel        |
| 5          | Top of the line capabilities — state of the art facilities and highly-skilled personnel.                    |


#### COMMAND
Command is the professionalism and organization of the ship’s crew, and its chain of command. It also represents how well the ship represents the virtues and nature of its culture, and conveys those things to both allies and outsiders, which can be valuable in diplomatic situations.

A character may use the ship’s Command with...
- ...Communications, to make an appropriate first impression when contacting others, or to coordinate effectively with other allied vessels during a crisis.
- ...Computers, to study the culture of another culture for a diplomatic briefing, or to research matters of law and regulation.
- ...Engines, to fly in precise formation, or on a precise course laid out by another.
- ...Sensors, to scan or monitor a vast area in close coordination with other vessels, or to try and discern the disposition (friend or foe, etc.) of an unknown vessel by its movements and actions.
- ...Structure, to present a particular disposition to another vessel or culture, or to adjust the internal conditions of part of the ship to suit a guest or visitor.
- ...Weapons, to fire a ‘warning shot’ to dissuade a hostile vessel, without risk of causing actual harm, or when using weapon systems to produce spectacular displays without inflicting damage.

#### CONN
Conn is the quality of the ship’s flight control and astronavigation systems, as well as the expertise of its flight crews and the maintenance personnel responsible for maintaining those systems.
A character may use the ship’s Conn with...

- ...Communications, to relay a plotted course, or detailed astrometric data, to another ship, either in advance or in real-time during travel.
- ...Computers, to study the astronomical phenomena and spatial variations present within a region, and to plot a course using that data, using the ship’s library and records.
- ...Engines, for most routine flight and maneuvering operations, as well as emergency maneuvers during a crisis.
- ...Sensors, to analyze the astronomical phenomena and spatial variations present within a region, and to plot a course using that data, where the data is obtained in real- time from the ship’s sensors.
- ...Structure, to effectively adjust the course, heading, and speed of a vessel in a situation where the ship’s integrity is under strain, or to alter the ship’s orientation to present a more resilient facing to an enemy or hazard.
- ...Weapons, to maneuver the ship in such a way as to maximize the effectiveness of the weapons, commonly known as an “attack pattern”.

#### ENGINEERING
Engineering represents the quality and quantity of the ship’s engineering and other technical personnel, as well as the tools and facilities they work with. A character may use the ship’s Engineering with...

- ...Communications, to alter the communication systems to break through interference or function on a non- standard frequency.
- ...Computers, to research technical schematics within the ship’s library, or to create a simulation of a device or mechanism to test its function.
- ...Engines, to adjust the output of the reactors or the propulsion systems, in order to produce an increased or different effect.
- ...Sensors, to perform diagnostics of a particular system on the ship, or to operate the ship’s teleporter (exceedingly rare) systems.
- ...Structure, to reinforce or alter the effects of the ship’s defenses, structural integrity, or inertial dampener systems, or to perform significant adjustments to the ship’s life support systems.
- ...Weapons, to alter weapon systems to overcome an unfamiliar form of defense or shielding, or when using weapon systems for precision cutting or demolition of an obstacle.


#### SECURITY 
Security represents the skill, training, and numbers of the ship’s security personnel, as well as other on-board security systems such as containment fields, and the refinement and calibration of tactical systems.
A character may use the ship’s Security with...
- ...Communications, to encrypt or decrypt classified information, or to intercept transmissions from others.
- ...Computers, to create combat or tactical simulations, or to use library archives to research the military capabilities of other vessels or cultures.
- ...Engines, to overcharge tactical systems (weapons, shields, etc.) to create a greater effect.
- ...Sensors, to try and discern the tactical capabilities of another vessel, or to detect the presence of intruders aboard their own ship.
- ...Structure, to alter or reinforce the ship’s shields against a specific threat, or to control the use of internal force fields to contain intruders.
- ...Weapons, to make attacks with the weapon systems against an enemy.

#### SCIENCE
Science represents the scientific personnel aboard the ship, their laboratories, their analytical facilities, and the other tools and systems available for analyzing data and studying the unknown.
A character may use the ship’s Science with...
- ...Communications, to attempt to translate or analyze an unknown language or form of communication, or to try and communicate with an unknown entity.
- ...Computers, to use the ship’s library archives to perform scientific research, or to analyze the results of an experiment or simulation.
- ...Engines, to produce a specific, unusual effect with the navigational deflector, the warp field coils, or some other aspect of the power and propulsion systems.
- ...Sensors, to scan and analyze spatial phenomena using the ship’s sensor arrays or a probe, or to examine and study samples using sophisticated equipment in the ship’s laboratories.
- ...Structure, to create or implement a theoretical defense against an unusual threat or hazard, or to alter environmental systems to repel a parasite or other hostile entity.
- ...Weapons, to find the specific modulation, frequency, or setting for a weapon system to achieve a specific unusual effect.

#### MEDICINE
Medicine represents the ship’s medical facilities (sickbay, and laboratories), as well as the personnel — doctors, nurses, lab technicians, orderlies — who work there. Most of the uses of Medicine are internal to the ship — making use of the facilities in the ship’s sickbay — rather than able to be projected outwards.
A character may use the ship’s Medicine with...
- ...Communications, to transfer large amounts of medical information, such as patient data, or the formula for a cure to a disease, between vessels or other facilities.
- ...Computers, to study the ship’s medical databases, or to analyze samples and tests taken from a patient.
- ...Engines, to ensure a stable flow of power into sensitive medical equipment.
- ...Sensors, to diagnose the ailments of a patient using a bio-bed or other sickbay scanner, or to gain more detailed information about the nature of life-forms scanned by the ship’s sensors.
- ...Structure, to create force fields that can contain or filter airborne pathogens, or to create a controlled environment for quarantine purposes.
- ...Weapons, to design a biogenic or biochemical payload for a torpedo.


### FOCUSES
Ships do not have foci

### TALENTS
Starships have Talents, just as characters do, normally representing areas of design and equipment focus; they provide similar benefits to the Talents of Player Characters, but the context is determined by the starship rather than by character behaviors.

### SIZE
Vessels come in a wide range of sizes, from tiny shuttlecraft to stately cruisers and grand battleships. A vessel’s Size is a representation of its size, and it influences several other ratings a starship will use. Size is a number, typically between 2 and 10 for Alliance vessels, with larger numbers representing bigger ships. Most vessels fall into this range, though some exceptional craft — such as Borg cubes — may be larger, while Size 1 is exclusively used for small craft such as shuttles.

A starship’s size is used to determine a number of other things, but it relates most importantly to the ship’s resilience — a ship with a greater Size can resist attacks more easily, and withstand greater amounts of damage before systems are damaged, disabled, or destroyed. Ships with greater Size can also project greater offensive power, allowing them to inflict greater damage with energy weapons like phasers and disruptors.

### RESISTANCE
Starships are designed to be resilient, for the rigors of space exploration are considerable, and a vessel may have to survive with little or no support for months or even years at a time. This durability — a mixture of the ship’s hull and spaceframe composition, the effectiveness of the structural integrity field and deflector shields, redundancies built into vital systems, and sheer size — is expressed as Resistance, which reduces incoming damage suffered by a ship in the same way as it does to a character or creature (though on a much larger size). A ship’s basic Resistance is equal to its Half it's Size (rounded down) + structure modifier, though other factors may modify or replace this.

### SHIELDS
Starships and starbases are commonly equipped with powerful layers of deflector shields. These powerful force fields are designed to protect from attacks and hazards, deflecting impacts and absorbing energy discharges. These shields are not impervious to harm, and sufficient force and power can weaken or even break through, damaging the hull and other systems beneath.

A starship or starbase has a Shields rating, and this is reduced when the ship is subjected to damage, and which can be replenished through the actions of the crew and with time. If a vessel suffers too much damage from a single attack or hazard, then it will also suffer serious damage, which impairs the ship’s function until repaired.

A ship normally has Shields equal to its Structure Modifier plus its Security modifier multiply that by 5, though other factors may modify or replace this. In most ways, a ship’s Shields are equivalent to a character’s Temporary Hitpoints. Shields are used before Resistance removes damage.

### POWER (Deprecated)
<!-- Vessels can generate massive amounts of power, but use much of it powering core systems like propulsion, shields, life support, sensors, computers, and so forth. A ship has a Power rating which represents its reserve and surplus power,
which can be spent to boost or support a variety of actions taken with the starship, and which can be lost because of some complications, hazards, and consequences.

At the start of each scene, the ship generates its full capacity of Power, and any Power which remained unused at the end of the previous scene is lost. This provides characters with a pool of points to draw from when attempting actions with the ship, or otherwise using technologies that draw from the ship’s power supplies. The basic operation of the ship — life support, communications, computers, and basic maneuvering — are assumed to have already been powered, and do not have to be considered under normal circumstances. Some actions — such as going to warp, or restoring depleted shields — require the expenditure of Power simply to perform the action, while others can gain a bonus from using additional power.

If no other benefit for using Power is listed, then the following effect can be used: when attempting a Task with the ship, one or more power may be spent before rolling, with each point increasing the Complication range of the Task by one. This represents the risk of overloads and problems from putting too much power into a system). If the Task is successful, then the character generates one additional Heroism for each point of Power spent.

Power can also be lost because of Complications, damage, environmental phenomena, unusual weapons, and a range of other effects. If the ship would lose more power than it has remaining — that is, if the loss is sufficient to reduce the ship’s current Power to less than 0 — then the ship suffers a Complication to a randomly-determined system. This Complication relates to the loss of vital power to some aspect of the ship’s operation.

Power is used to restore shields. When you use Regenerate shields it takes 1 power per point.

A ship’s normal Power capacity is equal to its Engines system, though other factors may alter this.

USES FOR POWER
| Power | Cost                                                        |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Move 1 zone                                                 |
| 1     | Fire energy weapon                                          |
| 2     | Per Extra Point of Energy Weapon Damage up to 3             |
| 2     | Restore 2 shields 2 for each additional                     |
| ?     | Go to warp - More power, faster escape, must match to catch |

Power resets every round of combat. It is uncommon for a ship to run out of power. In Simplified combat power is not tracked. -->

### CREW SUPPORT
Starships require a significant number of personnel, and a skilled officer knows best when to assign those personnel to different problems. Characters often have the advantage of Crew Support, in the form of these personnel. A ship has only a finite supply of Support, representing a small number of the crew available to them.

The total amount of Crew Support available is determined by the ship — each vessel has only a finite amount of crew on hand, most of whom will be busy on routine duties to keep the ship running, and form part of the background of the ship’s normal activities. Spending Crew Support brings members of the crew from that mass of background activity into the forefront, putting focus on them and making them an active and significant part of the adventure.

A ship’s normal allotment of Crew Support per mission is equal to its Size.

### SUBLIGHT
Type of Sublight

### FTL
Type of FTL

### CARGO
Size x 10 in Cargo Units

1 Cargo Unit 100 Tons. 

### HULL POINTS
Equal to Size * 5 + STRUCTURE

### ATMOSPHERIC CAPABLE
Can the ship operate in Atmosphere

### DEFENSE
This represents how hard the ship is to hit. Calculated as Security System + Engines modifier - 1/2 Size (rounded down). Larger ships are easier to hit because they are slower.

### ACTIONS ABOARD SHIP
A ship is as much a location for action, as it is a tool for the characters. In many situations, characters may be called upon to attempt Tasks while aboard their own ship. These actions are resolved normally, though at the Gamemaster’s discretion, the character may treat the ship’s facilities and personnel as an Advantage.

This option should be used in any situation where the ship itself is not the means by which the Task is being performed.

### SHIP ACTIONS
Conversely, if the character is actively making use of the ship itself to perform the Task — whether in small ways like using the ship’s library computer to research something, or in large ways like flying between systems or firing photon torpedoes — then the ship becomes a much more prominent part of the Task.

In these situations, the ship itself assists the character’s actions, rolling against a target number made from its own System and Department combination, and using one of its own Focuses, if relevant. It’s advisable to get another player to roll the ship’s dice for this purpose.

Except with the Gamemaster’s express permission, no more than one character may assist on a Ship Action (so the character being assisted is aided by the ship and up to one other character). Ship Actions are typically harder to get assistance for; you can only fit so many officers around a single console, after all.

# Starship Combat

## Step 1. Determine Distance
The GM determines the starting distance between two ships.

| Range Zone | Description                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Contact    | In the same Hex & touching, docked, etc |
| Close      | In the same Hex not touching            |
| Medium     | Within 1 Hexes                          |
| Long       | Within 2 Hexes                          |
| Extended   | Within 3 Hexes                          |
| Extended+  | 4+ Hexes                                |

## Step 2. Initiative
Each character rolls initiative as normal. The player in the "Pilot" seat is when the ship physicially moves. The rest of the grew goes in order. GM Determines enemy ship actiosn.

## Step 3. Shield Regen

## Step 5. Actions

## Action Economy
Each player can perform an Action a round. Ships can have only one person assigned to each station or role. 

### Minor Actions
| Action              | Difficulty | Test | Effect                                      |

| Change Position     | 0          | -    | Move to another station or part of the ship |
| Raise/Lower Shields | 0          | -    | Cannot be done in the same round            |
| Restore             | 0          | -    | Some actions call for this                  |

# Building a Starship

## Systems

### Starship
- Alliance Ships. 

### Smallcraft
- 45 points for a Runabout
- 30 points for Shuttlecraft

## Traits

### Ablative Armor
The vessel’s hull plating has an additional ablative layer that disintegrates slowly under extreme temperatures, such as those caused by energy weapons and torpedo blasts, dissipating the energy, and protecting the ship. This plating is replaced periodically. The ship’s Resistance is increased by 2.
2371 or later

### Ablative Armor Generator
The ship is fitted with a number of external replicators pre-set to materialize an outer layer of armor plating over the hull, reinforced with structural integrity fields that make it extraordinarily resilient. When the ship raises its Shields, it may deploy armor instead, by spending 3 Power. This increases the maximum Shields capacity by 5 and increases the ship’s Resistance by 3. While armor is deployed, the Modulate Shields and Regenerate Shields actions cannot be taken – the armor cannot be fine-tuned in those ways.
25th century or later

### Ablative Field Projector
The ship’s shield emitters are combined with an ablative field projector that allows its graviton field to be shared with another target in Close range. These projectors charge the target’s shields while dissipating its own. Doing so requires a Difficulty 1 Dexterity + Security task. On a success, your ship loses 1 Shield point and the target gains 1 Shield point. This process can be repeated any number of times by spending 1 Heroism for each swap.
25th century or later

### Adaptable Energy Weapons
The ship’s weapon delivery systems are enhanced by multiparticle emitters. These emitters allow for the ship’s energy weapon capabilities to be modified when fired. If desired, before an attack is rolled, the ship’s weapon’s Stress Rating is reduced by 1[D], but the officer making the attack roll may swap out any one Stress effect for another.
24th century or later

### Advanced Emergency Crew Holograms
The starship has the entirety of its interior spaces and some critical areas on its exterior outfitted with holoemitters, allowing the computer to project simulated personnel during emergencies. The ship has a number of holographic supporting characters (which should be pre-created) equal to half the ship’s Computers score, rounding up; their appearance and personality are determined when the ship is created. These can be activated or deactivated as a minor action, and they do not require any Crew Support to appear. They cannot operate away from the ship, and they do not improve when introduced in subsequent adventures.
2380 or later

### Advanced Research Facilities
The vessel is equipped with additional laboratories and long-term research facilities, which allow the crew to study phenomena over a protracted period, and thus generate a wealth of useful information. Whenever a character on board the ship attempts a Task to perform research, and they are assisted by the ship’s Computers + Science, the character gains one bonus Heroism, which must be used for the Obtain Information Heroism Spend.

### Advanced Sensor Suites
The vessel’s sensors are amongst the most sophisticated and advanced available in the fleet. Unless the ship’s Sensors have suffered one or more Breaches, whenever a character performs a Task assisted by the ship’s Sensors, they may reduce the Difficulty of the Task by one, to a minimum of 0.

### Advanced Shields
The vessel’s shields are state of the art, using developments that other cultures have not yet learned to overcome, or which simply provide greater protection for the same power expenditure. The ship’s maximum Shields are increased by 5.

### Advanced Sickbay
The ship’s medical ward or sickbay is well equipped, and larger than normal for a ship of this size. The ship gains the Advanced Medical Ward or Advanced Sickbay advantage, which applies to all tasks related to medicine and biology performed within the ward or sickbay. This advantage is lost if the ship’s Computers system is disabled.

### Annular Confinement Jacketing
The ship’s energy weapon emitters create an annular confinement beam around its energy beams, allowing the weapons to fire short distances at warp speeds. The ship may make an attack with its energy weapons at Close range while at warp; however, the Difficulty for the attack is increased by 2.
22nd century or later

### Automated Defenses
The ship’s weapons systems can automatically lock on to a target and fire. At the end of a combat round, if nobody fired a ship weapon, the ship may make an unassisted energy weapon attack using its Weapons + Security against a target. Heroism may be used and generated as normal for this attack.
23rd century or later

### Automated Return
The ship’s computer is programmed to recognize a starbase, colony, or some other location as its home base. The shuttles on board have the same programming and recognize the ship as their home base. If the ship’s Computers system goes for 10 days without commands from the crew, it will automatically pilot the ship back to the home base at maximum impulse.
23rd century or later

### Backup EPS Conduits
The ship’s power conduits have additional redundancies, which can be activated to reroute power more easily in case of an emergency, keeping it from being lost when the ship is damaged. Whenever the ship would lose one or more Power because of suffering damage, roll [D] for each Power lost. Each Effect rolled prevents the loss of that point of Power.

### Captain's Yacht
The vessel has a single additional support craft, normally mounted in a dedicated port under the saucer section of the ship. These craft, larger than most shuttles, are often used for diplomatic missions and special excursions by the commanding officer, and are often known as the Captain’s Yacht (though not always; some Intrepid-class vessels have a similar craft called an aeroshuttle). The ship has one additional Small Craft, which does not count against the number which may be active at any one time.

### Cloaked Mines
The ship’s mines are equipped with state-of-the-art cloaking technology, making them almost impossible to detect. Mines that the ship places have the Hidden 2 Weapon Quality.

### Cloaking Device
The vessel has a device that allows it to vanish from sensors. Operating the device requires a Dexterity + Engineering task with a Difficulty of 2, assisted by the ship’s Engines + Security as this is a task from the tactical position. This task has a Power requirement of 3. If successful, the vessel gains the Cloaked trait. While cloaked, the vessel cannot attempt any attacks, nor can it be the target of an attack unless the attacker has found some way of detecting the cloaked vessel. While cloaked, a vessel’s shields are down. It requires a minor action to decloak a vessel.

### Command Ship
The ship has command and control systems allowing it to coordinate easily with allies during a crisis. When a character on the ship succeeds at a Direct Task to create an Advantage, they may always be assisted by the ship’s Communications + Command, and they may confer the Advantage to allied ships or away teams with whom the ship maintains a communications link.

### Dedicated Personnel
The ship gains two additional Crew Support, which may only be used to establish Supporting Characters.

### Dedicated Personnel (Command)
The ship gains two additional Crew Support, which may only be used to establish Supporting Characters who are part of the Command department.

### Dedicated Personnel (Conn)
The ship gains two additional Crew Support, which may only be used to establish Supporting Characters who are part of the Conn department.

### Dedicated Personnel (Engineering)
The ship gains two additional Crew Support, which may only be used to establish Supporting Characters who are part of the Engineering department.

### Dedicated Personnel (Medicine)
The ship gains two additional Crew Support, which may only be used to establish Supporting Characters who are part of the Medicine department.

### Dedicated Personnel (Science)
The ship gains two additional Crew Support, which may only be used to establish Supporting Characters who are part of the Science department.

### Dedicated Personnel (Security)
The ship gains two additional Crew Support, which may only be used to establish Supporting Characters who are part of the Security department.

### Dedicated Subspace Tranceiver Array
A starship with this talent has a section of its hull that slides away where a long, tether-like subspace transceiver array can be deployed to enhance the vessel’s communication range and clarity, even at warp. Any tasks involving sending, receiving, or intercepting subspace or standard EM communications have their Difficulty reduced by 1.

### Deluxe Galley
The ship’s mess hall is equipped with top-of-the-line food preparation systems as well as vast stores of non- replicated food. Whenever the ship’s cook or chef uses their role ability while in the ship’s galley, they generate 1 additional Heroism. In addition, whenever a crew member meets with a guest of the ship in the galley, they gain the Fine Dining advantage, which comes into play with all Presence and Command tasks.

### Diplomatic Suites
The ship has numerous high-quality staterooms for hosting VIPs, as well as briefing rooms and other facilities that allow the ship to serve as a neutral ground for diplomatic summits, trade negotiations, and similar functions. When hosting negotiations, members of the crew may be assisted by the ship’s Computers + Command or Structure + Command.

### Dual Environment
The ship is outfitted with redundant system rooms that can be filled with gases or liquids that allow crew members requiring different atmospheric conditions to work side by side with the rest of the crew. In addition, passages that can be filled with the necessary liquids or gases run parallel to all passages in the ship, allowing these crew members to move freely throughout. A character who is in a redundant system room may assist others in the connected system room as if they were in the same room.

### Electronic Warfare Systems
The ship’s communications systems have been speciallydesigned to intercept and disrupt enemy communications in battle. Whenever a character on the ship succeeds at the Intercept or Signals Jamming Tasks, they may spend 2 Heroism to select one additional ship to target.

### Emergency Medical Hologram
The ship’s sickbay is equipped with holoemitters and a stateof-the-art holographic doctor, able to assist medical personnel during emergencies. The ship has one additional Supporting Character, an Emergency Medical Hologram, using the Attributes, Disciplines, and so forth as shown in the sidebar, which does not cost any Crew Support to introduce, and which does not automatically improve when introduced. This character cannot go into any location not equipped with holoemitters.
2371 or later

### Expanded Munitions
The ship has been designed to defend itself from all manner of threats. As such, it has either additional energy delivery systems or extended storage for torpedoes or mines. The ship may add any one weapon to its profile. This talent may be taken multiple times, adding a different weapon each time. Any prerequisites for the weapon or its delivery system still apply.

### Expansive Department
This talent represents a highly-focused starship with many specialists in their field working closely together to perform tasks at peak efficiency. This talent must be taken for a starship to have a department score of 6 through application of a mission profile or through game events and player actions. Starbases do not need this talent to have a department above 5. All tasks that include this Expansive Department have a target number calculated as normal. Whenever the ship assists a task using this department, or performs a task on its own using this department, the ship may re-roll a d20.

### Extensive Shuttlebays
The vessel’s shuttlebays are large, well-supplied, and able to support a larger number of active shuttle missions simultaneously. The ship may have twice as many small craft active at any one time as it would normally allow, and it may carry up to two Size 2 small craft.

### Fast Targeting Systems
The ship’s targeting systems can lock weapons on target much faster and more accurately than other ships of its class, giving it an edge in battle. The ship does not suffer the normal Difficulty increase for targeting a specific System on the enemy ship.

### Grappler Cables
This precursor to tractor beams uses sturdy cables and magnetic grapplers to grab on to objects and ships. This functions as a tractor beam, but if the target breaks free, roll 1[D] — on an Effect, the cables have been Damaged and cannot be used again until repaired.

### High-Power Tractor Beam
The ship’s tractor beam systems channel far greater quantities of power and exert much more force on the target. The ship’s tractor beam has a strength two higher than normal. Further, the ship may spend Power whenever a target attempts to escape the tractor beam to increase its strength for that attempt; the strength increases by 1 for every two Power spent.

### High-Resolution Sensors
The vessel’s sensors can gain large amounts of accurate data, though they are extremely sensitive. While the vessel is not in combat, any successful task that is assisted by the ship’s Sensors gains one bonus Heroism.

### Improved Damage Control
The ship has more efficient damage reporting systems, and better-trained teams of technicians, allowing the crew to respond more quickly to damage during a crisis. When a character takes the Damage Control Task aboard this ship, they may re-roll a single d20. If the repairs require an Extended Task, then the characters also gain Progression 1, adding +1 to Work done for each Effect rolled.

### Improved Hull Integrity
The ship’s hull has been reinforced to hold together better under stress and damage. The ship’s Resistance is increased by 1.

### Improved Impulse Drive
The ship’s Impulse drives are more powerful than on most ships, allowing the ship to accelerate much more quickly. When the flight controller succeeds at the Impulse, Attack Pattern, Evasive Action, or Ramming Speed Tasks, they may spend 2 Heroism to increase the Difficulty of attacks against the ship by 1 until the start of the flight controller’s next Turn, due to the ship’s rapid acceleration.

### Improved Power Systems
The ship’s power systems are extremely efficient, allowing power to be redirected and rerouted from different systems very quickly. Whenever a character succeeds at a Power Management Task, the ship gains 2 Power per Heroism spent (Repeatable) instead of 1.

### Improved Reaction Control System
The ship’s maneuvering thrusters operate with greater precision, allowing the ship to adjust its course more carefully. Whenever a Task to move or maneuver the ship would increase in Difficulty because of obstacles or hazards, reduce the Difficulty by 1 (to a minimum of the Task’s normal Difficulty).

### Improved Shield Recharge
The ship’s deflector shields have redundant capacitors and emitter arrays that allow the shields to be recharged and replenished much more efficiently. Whenever the Regenerate Shields Task is successful, the ship regains 3 points of Shields, plus 3 more for each Heroism spent (Repeatable), instead of the normal amount.

### Improved Warp Drive
The ship’s warp drive is more efficient, capitalizing on improved field dynamics, better control of antimatter flow rates, or some other advancement that allows the ship to expend less energy when travelling at warp. Whenever the ship spends power to go to warp, roll 1 for each Power spent; for each Effect rolled, that point of Power is not spent.

### Independent Phaser Supply
The ship’s phasers use an independent power supply, rather than drawing directly from the ship’s other power sources. Attacking with the ship’s phasers no longer has a Power Requirement. However, the ship may not spend additional Power to boost the effectiveness of an attack with the phasers.

### Modular Laboratories
The ship has considerable numbers of empty, multi-purpose compartments that can be converted to laboratories as and when required. At the start of an adventure, the crew may decide how the modular laboratories are configured; this configuration counts as an Advantage which applies to work performed within the laboratories.

### Nuclear Warheads
The vessel is equipped with nuclear warheads in addition to its spatial torpedoes.

### Photonic Torpedoes
The vessel is equipped with photonic torpedoes instead of spatial torpedoes.

### Point Defense System
The ship is equipped with a system of small energy weapon emitters that operates independently from the main weapons systems. When a torpedo targets the ship, these emitters start firing in the direction it is traveling from, potentially destroying it before it impacts the shields or the ship’s hull. This system only works at subwarp speeds. The ship is considered to have Cover 2[D] against torpedo attacks.

### Polarized Hull Plating
The ship does not have deflector shielding, but rather is equipped with layers of hull plating that can be polarized to resist attack. This functions in the same way as Shields do, with one difference: the ship suffers a Breach if four or more damage is suffered after deductions for Resistance.

### Quantum Torpedoes
The vessel has been equipped with the latest in ship-to-ship munitions: the quantum torpedoes. The ship has quantum torpedoes in addition to any other form of torpedo it carries.
2371 or later

### Rapid-Fire Torpedo Launcher
The vessel’s torpedo launchers have been redesigned to allow the ship to fire multiple torpedoes much more quickly and accurately. Whenever the crew add 3 to Threat to fire a torpedo salvo, they may re-roll a single d20 on the attack, and any number of [D] on the damage roll.

### Redundant Systems
The ship has multiple additional redundancies that allow it to withstand severe damage more easily. Nominate a single System. When that system becomes Damaged or Disabled, the crew may choose to activate the backups as a Minor Action; if the System was Damaged, it is no longer Damaged. If it was Disabled, it becomes Damaged instead. A System’s backups may only be activated once per adventure, so subsequent damage will have the normal effect.

### Regenerative Hull
The ship’s hull is infused with reverse-engineered Borg nanite technology that seeks out and repairs the hull immediately when it is damaged, often preventing a breach before it can happen. The amount of Stress needed for the ship to sustain a breach is increased by 1.
25th century or later

### Rugged Design
The ship is designed with the frontier in mind, with a durable construction and easy access to critical systems that allow repairs to be made easily. Reduce the Difficulty of all Tasks to repair the ship by 1, to a minimum of 1.

### Saucer Separation
The ship is designed so that the saucer section can be separated from the engineering section, to operate as two distinct ships. Each section has the same Systems, Departments, Talents, and weapons, but their Size is one lower than the whole ship (recalculate anything derived from Size), and each section only has half the Power (round down) that the ship had before separation. Further, if the ship has suffered any damage, ongoing effects of that damage apply equally to both sections. The saucer section, which contains the crew quarters and recreational areas, does not have the capacity to go to warp.

### Secondary Reactors
The ship has additional impulse and fusion reactors, that allow the ship to generate far greater quantities of energy. Double Engine Modifier.

### Self-Replicating Mines
The ship carries mines that are capable of replicating themselves over time, allowing for a more thorough spread filling the area they’re deployed in. The Difficulty of any task made to avoid the mines does not reduce when mines are detonated.
2371 or later

### Siphoning Shields
The vessel’s shield emitters are connected to a network of particle siphons that capture some of the energy released when hit by an energy weapon, channeling it back into the shields. When the ship is hit by an energy weapon, after Stress is rolled, roll 1[D] for each point of Shields lost, then regain a number of Shield points equal to the number of effects rolled.

### Slim Sensor Silhouette
Through a combination of advanced alloys, EM shielding, and electronic countermeasures, the starship is difficult to detect via electromagnetic radiation and subspace sensors. While not a true cloaking device, these vessels can sneak into star systems entirely undetected. Like a cloaking device, utilizing the EM shielding and ECM systems on board requires a Dexterity + Engineering task with a Difficulty of 2. If this task is successful, the maximum Power rating of the ship is reduced by 2 to represent the power usage of the systems and “running silent,” and shields are deactivated. All tasks to detect the stealthy starship have their Difficulty increased by 1. There are no restrictions on weapons fire from the ship using this talent.

### Specialized Crew (Command)
Rare in The Alliance, a starship with a specialized crew has had personnel assigned to it primarily from a specific division. During an adventure, if the players wish to introduce supporting characters, they may not use more than half their ship’s Crew Support rating on characters from divisions outside of the ship’s specialty. An example of this is the Crossfield class that is specialized with the Science division and is Size 4. This means that only two crew points could be used for supporting characters from the Command or Operations divisions, while the other two could be used only for the Science division.

### Specialized Crew (Operations)
Rare in The Alliance, a starship with a specialized crew has had personnel assigned to it primarily from a specific division. During an adventure, if the players wish to introduce supporting characters, they may not use more than half their ship’s Crew Support rating on characters from divisions outside of the ship’s specialty. An example of this is the Crossfield class that is specialized with the Science division and is Size 4. This means that only two crew points could be used for supporting characters from the Command or Operations divisions, while the other two could be used only for the Science division.

### Specialized Crew (Science)

During an adventure, if the players wish to introduce supporting characters, they may not use more than half their ship’s Crew Support rating on characters from divisions outside of the ship’s specialty. An example of this is the Crossfield class that is specialized with the Science division and is Size 4. This means that only two crew points could be used for supporting characters from the Command or Operations divisions, while the other two could be used only for the Science division.

### Tachyon Detection Field
The ship is equipped with a field generator that projects a cloud of tachyons around it. Activating the field generator requires a Dexterity + Engineering task with a Difficulty of 2, assisted by the ship’s Sensors + Science, and has a Power requirement of 2. The field remains active until the ship moves. While the field is active, the ship is notified of any cloaked vessels that are within or pass into Close range. The ship may attack a cloaked target within the field, though the Difficulty for the attack is increased by 2.
25th century or later

### Teleporter Equipped
The ship is equipped with an experimental Teleporter which uses magic to function, this includes a team of three staff that channel Astra to operate this. Use as Teleport spell assuming the ship has a Teleportation circle.

### Variable Geometry Warp Field
An extension of the variable pitch warp nacelles seen on the Intrepid class and the warp vector technology found on many Vulcan-designed starships, a ship with a variable geometry warp field can adjust its subspace field in highly turbulent spacetime and can continue to provide propulsive force even then. These vessels provide the advantage of Variable Geometry Warp Field in any scene involving a disadvantage related to difficulties forming or maintaining a stable warp field.
The talent is known as VARIABLE GEOMETRY WARP DRIVE in the Captain's Log book.

### Versatile Tractor Beam
The ship has exotic particle emitters integrated with its tractor beam system. With a few simple adjustments, the tractor beam can become even more useful against ships trapped within. When the tractor beam is activated, the operator may choose to add one of the following effects:
Depleting: At the end of each round a target remains within the tractor beam, it loses 1 Shield.
Draining: At the end of each round a target remains within the tractor beam, it loses 1 Power.
25th century or later
