## Spell Descriptions

### ADVANCED HAYWIRE
5th-level evocation

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a frayed universal cable)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- Classes: Artificer, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard
You cause machines to undergo catastrophic failure. Choose a point you can see within range. The vehicles, lights, speakers, and wires in a 60-foot cube centered on that point begin to malfunction dangerously until the spell ends.

Vehicles. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a vehicle in the area to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you can cause the vehicle to move up to its movement speed in a straight line, but not outside the cube. On a successful save, the vehicle is unaffected.

Lights. At the end of each of your turns, you can choose one light source in the area. Creatures within 10 feet of the light source that can see it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn.

Speakers. You are aware of all speakers in the spell’s area. At the start of each of your turns, you can choose one speaker or a machine with a speaker, such as a walkie talkie or smartphone, in the cube. Each creature in a 15-foot cone from the speaker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 thunder damage and be deafened for 1 minute.

Wires. Wires tear themselves out of the ground, floor, and walls and begin sparking violently. When a creature moves into or within the area, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 lightning damage for every 5 feet it travels until the start of its next turn.

### ARCANE GRAFFITI
Conjuration cantrip

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: 1 hour
This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or a short message, which can be no larger than 2 feet tall and consist of no more than six words, on a nonliving creature or object. The writing can be visible or invisible. An arcane graffiti spell enables you to etch the words upon any substance (even stone or metal) without harming the material upon which the mark is placed. If invisible graffiti is made, the casting of any spell within 30 feet causes the words to become visible for 5 rounds.

### AWAKEN VEHICLE
6th-level transmutation

- Casting Time: 8 hours
- Range: Touch
- Components: V S M (holy motor oil worth at least 150,000₵, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Cleric, Druid, Bard
After spending the casting time tracing blessed motor oil in magical roadways along the exterior of the vehicle, you touch a huge or smaller vehicle. The vehicle becomes a sentient vehicle, and gains an Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. The vehicle gains senses similar to a human’s.

The awakened vehicle is charmed by you for 30 days or until you and your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened vehicle chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the vehicle can be of any size.

### BOOMERANG SHOT
Cantrip transmutation

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Firearm range
- Components: V M (a ranged weapon)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon against one target within the weapon’s range. If the attack misses the projectile loops around, and you can use your reaction to make the attack again at the same target, ignoring advantage, disadvantage, and cover, and without consuming additional ammunition. If the attack misses a second time, roll your weapon’s damage dice. You take the rolled amount as damage of the weapon’s damage type.

The attack deals an extra 1d8 damage when you reach 5th level (1d8), 11th level (2d8), and 17th level (3d8).

### BURGLAR'S BUDDY
2nd-level illusion (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Self (10-foot radius)
- Components: V, S, M (a camera lens cover)
- Duration: 1 minute
You create a magical area around you, suppressing all mechanical or electronic intrusion alarms and alarms sensors in the area. Burglar alarms or other intrusion alarms within the affected area simply fail to function; sensors for intrusion alarm systems (such as motion detectors, IR detectors, pressure sensors, electric eyes, and so forth) also fail to function, sending no signal to monitoring stations. Video surveillance devices stop sending whatever the image they were photographing the moment when the spell was cast.

### CAMOUFLAGE VEHICLE
3rd-level illusion

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V S M (an unpaid parking ticket)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
- Classes: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Wizard
A vehicle you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Creatures are also invisible while riding the vehicle. While you are within 60 feet of the vehicle, you can speak a command word to end the spell. The spell ends when the vehicle or any creature inside attacks, casts a spell, or takes damage.

### CHAOS SHOT
2nd-level evocation

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Firearm range
- Components: V M (a ranged weapon)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Artificer, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged attack with a weapon against a creature or vehicle within range. If you hit, your ammunition erupts with chaotic magical energy. Roll a d8. The number rolled on the d8 determines the damage type for all attacks made as part of this spell, as shown below.

| D8  | DAMAGE TYPE |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1   | Acid        |
| 2   | Cold        |
| 3   | Fire        |
| 4   | Force       |
| 5   | Lightning   |
| 6   | Poison      |
| 7   | Psychic     |
| 8   | Thunder     |

Additionally, on a hit the shot must redirect itself from the target to a different creature or vehicle of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, which could cause the shot to redirect again, targeting up to a maximum of 5 targets. A target can be targeted only once per turn by these attacks.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, each target of this spell takes an additional 1d8 damage for each slot level above 2nd.

### COMMANDEER VEHICLE
7th-level enchantment

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- Classes: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
You attempt to commandeer a vehicle that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be controlled by you. If it currently has a driver, it has advantage on the saving throw.

 While the vehicle is commandeered, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required). The vehicle becomes sentient and can perform its own actions to obey your commands. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Drive in that direction,” “Run over that creature,” or “Crash into that wall.” If the vehicle completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it does nothing.

A creature at the vehicle’s controls can attempt to wrench control away from you, causing the vehicle to make a new Constitution saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 9th level, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

### CONJURE TURRET
2nd-level conjuration (ritual)

- Casting Time: 1 bonus action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V S M (a shell casing)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
- Classes: Artificer, Cleric, Paladin, Ranger
A tripod mounted weapon appears, fully loaded, and ready for combat. The turret manifests physically on a surface in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. Alternatively you can manifest it on a vehicle that is Large or larger which you can see within range, and which has space for a mounted weapon. Choose one of the following options for what appears.

An assault cannon
A gatling gun
A rocket launcher
This magic weapon can be used normally as a mounted massive weapon, except that it cannot be unmounted, and you can reload it with conjured magical ammunition as a bonus action while you are within 60 feet of it. The ammunition disappears when the spell ends. You are proficient with this weapon. Creatures can move freely through its space.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 force damage when it hits for every two slot levels above the 2nd. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can use your bonus action to attack twice with this weapon using your spellcasting modifier while you are within 60 feet of it.

### CONTRACT
3rd-level enchantment (ritual)

- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: 10 feet
- Components: V S M (a written, typed, or digital contract)
- Duration: Special
- Classes: Artificer, Bard, Warlock, Wizard
When you cast this spell, you bind the souls of two parties to a contract, forcing them to adhere to it or suffer dire penalties. Choose two willing creatures within range. They must verbally agree to the terms of the contract used as the material component for the spell, and must not be suffering from the charmed condition. The contract also has a length which determines the duration of the spell, up to 1 year.

When you cast this spell, choose agony, death, or misfortune as the penalty for violating the contract, which the targeted creatures are aware of before agreeing to the terms. At the DM's discretion, you may choose an alternative effect for violating the contract, but it should be no more powerful than those described below.

Once both creatures have agreed to the contract, the spell takes effect. If either creature is ever in violation of the terms of the contract, down to the letter, it suffers the effects of the chosen penalty. The penalty is in effect until the creature is in accordance with the terms of the contract.

Agony. Every day at dawn, the creature takes 6d6 psychic damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, the creature falls unconscious and is stable.

Death. Every day at dawn, the creature takes 1d6 necrotic damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

Misfortune. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma and Wisdom saving throws. Additionally, when the creature rolls a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you instead treat the roll as if it were a 1.

The spell can be ended early if both creatures verbally agree to end it while within 10 feet of each other, so long as each creature is not suffering from the charmed condition. A remove curse spell also ends this spell if it is cast using a spell slot level equal to or higher than the spell slot used to cast this spell. If the spell is ended early, both creatures are aware of it.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

### DATAREAD
2nd-level divination (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You run your finger over any machine-readable data source (a barcode, a computer disk, a USB drive, or any similar record) to understand the content of the data. You experience the data as it would normally be experienced through an appropriate machine. For example, if reading a USB with music, you hear the music in your head. If reading a word processor file, you visualize and read an image of the page. If reading a barcode, you see the serial number, pricing information, or other barcoded data.

The amount of time required to experience the data is the same as that required to read it by conventional means. You can normally read 2 pages of documents in 1 minute. This spell does not decode encrypted data. Without the encryption code, an encrypted document or file appears as a seemingly random string of characters. If you know the encryption code, however, you can read encrypted data normally with this spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for 10 minutes. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for 1 hour.

### DECOMPOSE
2nd-level necromancy

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V S M (a pinch of grave dirt)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
This spell rapidly causes the body to decay. There are two possible uses for the spell, depending on whether the target is a living or dead creature.

If you cast this spell targeting a living creature, make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 necrotic damage.

If you cast this spell targeting a dead creature, the body rapidly decays, increasing the amount of time the creature has been dead by 10 days for the purposes of the time limit on raising the target from the dead. For example, a dead creature targeted by this spell could not be returned to life by the raise dead spell.


 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell targeting a living creature using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

If you cast this spell targeting a dead creature using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the amount of time the creature has been dead increases to 100 years. If you cast this spell targeting a dead creature using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the amount of time the creature has been dead increases to 200 years.

> DM TIP: STAYING DEAD
In a cyberpunk world that has high amounts of magic, it may be difficult for the player characters to keep a creature dead. After all, if resurrection magic exists, a corporation would undoubtedly have the resources to pay for it, and the wealthy could have death insurance contracts that include attempts to raise the contract holder from the dead. What are are the player characters to do? There are numerous options, including dissolving it in acid, or burning it to ashes. However, with the resurrection spell, a VIP could still be returned to life, though at great expense. The player characters could also use the decompose spell to rapidly age the body out of easy raising, or make it completely impossible to resurrect with higher levels of the spell.

### DEGAUSS
1st-level transmutation (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous
By touching a single device that contains electronic files, such as a computer, external hard drive, USB flash drive, or magnetic disk, you erase all files on that device. The device is rendered empty of data.

## ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE
3rd-level evocation (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous
When you cast this spell, you send a powerful burst of energy that ruins electronic circuitry in a 20-foot cube. Any computer, telephone, television, or other device with a computer processor inside ceases to function immediately, and the contents of hard drives and other storage media are scrambled.

The electromagnetic pulse affects only devices with extensive circuitry, not everything that uses electricity. Ordinarily the lights stay on, although their electronic switches might not function. Automobiles continue to run, although their engines will run more roughly without electronic guidance. Cars with an electronic ignition system won't start after the spell.

Devices affected by this spell can be fixed using an engineering kit.

### FIND RIDE
2nd-level conjuration

- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V S
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Paladin
You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a sentient motorcycle, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the motorcycle can move and act independently. It has the statistics of a motorcycle, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a construct. Additionally, the motorcycle’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma become 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak. The vehicle has senses similar to a human’s.

Your motorcycle serves you as a vehicle, both in and out of combat, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. You are considered proficient with land vehicles while driving your summoned motorcycle, if you were not already. While driving your motorcycle, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your motorcycle.

When the motorcycle drops to 0 hit points, it explodes, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your motorcycle at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same motorcycle, restored to its hit point maximum.

While your motorcycle is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.

You can't have more than one motorcycle bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the motorcycle from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can summon a sports motorcycle. If you use a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can summon a warcycle with a flying speed of 140 feet.

### FIND THE ROAD
4th-level transmutation

- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: Touch
- Components: V S M (a bit of road tar)
- Duration: 8 hours
- Classes: Druid, Ranger
Touch one land vehicle. For the duration, as the vehicle travels, a magical paved road emerges from the ground or water, pushing aside natural terrain, as well as trees under 5 feet in width.


 The shape of the terrain is not altered, so rock walls, cliffs, and mountains are unaffected. After the vehicle passes, the road vanishes behind it, and the terrain regains its original form.

The vehicle can travel no faster than a rate of 80 feet per round in combat or 40 miles per hour out of combat on this road.

### HAYWIRE
Transmutation cantrip (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a small magnet)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This cantrip causes a single device to behave randomly and erratically, defying any attempts to bring it under control. Cash registers display random prices and open their money drawers repeatedly. Escalators surge forward, then reverse themselves. Automatic teller machines flash random patrons' account balances on the screen as they spew forth receipts (not money, though).

It's impossible to describe the exact effects of haywire on every modern device. In general, a machine subject to haywire functions as if someone were pressing random buttons or otherwise manipulating it randomly.

Turning off a device subject to a haywire spell doesn't work, because the spell disables the “off” switch. Cutting off the power supply (by unplugging it, for example) disables the device 1d4 rounds later, ending the spell.

This cantrip doesn't disable the devices (for example, a camera might get a static effect but it will continue recording, and a door with an electronic lock might not be openable while is under the effects of this cantrip)

### INSTANT CONNECTIVITY
5th-level conjuration (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 10 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a device connected to internet worth at least 100)
- Duration: Instantaneous
With the aid of instant messaging software, you physically transport the subject or subjects from one place to another. If several willing creatures link hands in a circle, up to eight creatures can be affected by the spell at the same time.

At least one of the creatures affected must be touching a computer with Internet connection. The targets must be sent to a specific computer that is currently active online. Instant connectivity causes the targets to appear in the room from which the receiving device is, automatically gaining surprise on anyone else in that room.

You must have seen the receiving device for at least 1 minute from 5 feet or less to be able to target that device.

If any of the devices have some kind of security (or if the device is in a secure network), the spell cannot be casted until the security is disabled (for more information about disabling security, read the "Using Electronic Devices" section).

### JAM SIGNALS
3rd-level abjuration
- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Self
- Components: V S M (a burnt out wireless chip)
- Duration: 10 minutes
- Classes: Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
A 100-foot-radius invisible sphere surrounds you. All wireless and radio connections within this sphere are suppressed. Machines with functions that rely on wireless or radio connection, such as walkie talkies and wireless transceivers, cease to function while within the sphere. These machines also cannot receive signals from outside the sphere.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius is increased by 50 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

### KNACK
Cantrip transmutation

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V S
- Duration: Up to 1 hour
- Classes: Artificer, Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
This spell allows minor influence over nearby machines and technology. You create one of the following technological effects within range.

- You create a Large or smaller AR object or creature for up to 1 hour. If you create a creature, it follows your mental orders. If the object or creature is ever more than 60 feet away from you, it vanishes.
- You cause a display device you can see, such as a smartphone screen or computer monitor, to show a popup advertisement of your choice for up to 1 hour. It can include audio and video elements. Ability checks made with the device have disadvantage.
- You cause an audio device you can see to play sounds of your choice for up to 1 hour.
- You instantaneously flip a visible power switch or button on a device to turn it on or off.
- You instantaneously make a harmless shower of sparks or arc of electricity pop out of a device.
- Choose one machine weighing up to 5 pounds that isn’t being worn or carried. The machine moves up to 20 feet in a direction of your choice.
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

### MACHINE INVISIBILITY
1st-level illusion (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a glass lens, which the caster fogs by breathing on it)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A creature or object you touch cannot be detected by video cameras, electronic sensors, or other high-tech detection machines for the duration of the spell. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The target remain visible to vision.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

### MAGIC ID
Illusion cantrip

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S, M (a small card or slip of paper)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You touch a small card or slip of paper appear to be a valid identification card of your choosing. The card bears your name, likeness, and all other data expected by anyone examining such a card. However, it is only visually accurate and does not contain any valid machine-readable data or electronic coding. You cannot use this spell to make an electronic passkey.

### MUFFLE
Cantrip illusion

- Casting Time: 1 bonus action
- Range: Touch
- Components: S M (a firearm)
- Duration: 1 minute
- Classes: Artificer, Bard, Wizard
You touch a firearm that lacks the blast property and create a small field of silence around its firing mechanisms and muzzle. For the duration, any attacks made with the weapon make no sound. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

### POWER DEVICE
1st-level transmutation (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You touch an electrical or mechanical device that requires a power source. For the duration of the spell, the device functions exactly as it normally would if it had conventional power.

This spell can affect any household or handheld device, or general-purpose vehicle. Larger or more intricate devices cannot be powered with this spell.

### NUKE
9th-level evocation

- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: Sight
- Components: V S M (500,000₵ worth of highly radioactive material, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Sorcerer, Wizard
When you begin casting this spell, sirens blare in 1 mile radius centered on a point you can see. There is a flash of light, a deafening boom, and a mushroom cloud rises 1,000 feet high if space allows. Each target in a 360-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution

saving throw. The blast spreads around corners. A target takes 12d12 radiant damage and 12d12 thunder damage and gains 2 levels of irradiated on a failed save, or half as much damage and no levels of irradiated on a successful one.

Additionally, the area within 1 mile of the point is irradiated for 1 week. Creatures who spend a total of 1 hour within the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of irradiated.

### REBOUND SHOT
Cantrip divination

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Firearm range
- Components: V M (a ranged weapon)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Artificer, Bard, Warlock, Sorcerer, Wizard
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you choose a point you can see within range of the weapon, and fire your weapon at that point. When the projectile arrives at the point, you momentarily gain sight from its location. Immediately after, you can redirect the projectile to make a ranged weapon attack against a target you can see from the projectile’s location, as if you had made the attack with the weapon. You do not have advantage on the attack roll due to the target not being able to see you.

The attack deals an extra 1d8 damage when you reach 5th level (1d8), 11th level (2d8), and 17th level (3d8).

### RECONSTRUCT VEHICLE
4th-level transmutation

- Casting Time: 1 hour
- Range: Touch
- Components: V S M (holy powdered chrome worth at least 50,000₵, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Wizard

You rebuild a destroyed vehicle you touch which is of Large size or smaller, restoring its functionality. You must have the majority of the vehicle’s remains, even if it is only a burnt out husk.

The vehicle is restored to its maximum hit points, with all modifications it originally had, and any lost parts are magically replaced. The vehicle’s fuel tanks and batteries are full.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher and use 200,000₵ worth of materials, the vehicle may be of huge size or smaller. If you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher and use 800,000₵, the vehicle may be of gargantuan size or smaller.

### RELAY TEXT
2nd-level transmutation (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Unlimited
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous
You cause a text message of up to 25 words to appear on the screen of an electronic device capable of receiving such messages, such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer. If the device is turned on, the message appears instantly; if not, the message appears as soon as someone turns it on.

### SUMMON VEHICLE
3rd-level conjuration

- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V S M (enchanted fuel worth 2,500₵, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hours
- Classes: Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Wizard
You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a vehicle of your choice, but its challenge rating must be 2 or lower, and it must lack a flying speed. It appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. It has the statistics of a vehicle, but it is sentient, and it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a construct. Additionally, the vehicle’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma become 10, and it gains the ability to speak one language of your choice that you speak. The vehicle has senses similar to a human’s.

The vehicle is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the vehicle, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the vehicle, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

When the vehicle drops to 0 hit points, it explodes, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your vehicle as an action, causing it to disappear and the spell to end.

If your concentration is broken, the vehicle doesn’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the vehicle. An uncontrolled vehicle can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 8 hours after you summoned it. The DM rolls a 1d8 and consults the Uncontrolled Vehicle table to determine the vehicle’s actions.


D8	DAMAGE TYPE
- 1	The vehicle becomes hostile toward all other creatures, and may attack.
- 2	The vehicle becomes hostile toward all other vehicles, and may attack.
- 3	The vehicle attempts to destroy itself by crashing into random nearby targets and driving itself off ledges.
- 4	The vehicle becomes extremely demanding, and won’t follow your orders until you feed it 5,000₵ of premium fuel or oil.
- 5	The vehicle gains a flying speed of 40 feet and immediately begins to fly as high as it can. You may be able to persuade the car to return to the ground for a short period of time, at the DM’s discretion.
- 6	The vehicle refuses to move and begins playing loud, irritating music of the DMs choice through its speakers while flashing all of its lights.
- 7	The vehicle becomes frightened of violence, driving as fast as it can away from danger, and attempts to take up a peaceful life as a driverless taxi or a similar career.
- 8	The vehicle is docile, and continues to follow your orders.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the vehicle can have a flying speed.

### SYNCHRONICITY
5th-level abjuration

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
The creature you touch feels reality subtly shifted to its favor while this spell is in effect. The target isn't inconvenienced by mundane delays of any sort. Traffic lights are always green, there is always a waiting elevator, and a taxi is always around the corner. The target can run at full speed through dense crowds, and attacks of opportunity provoked by the target’s movement are made with disadvantage.

Synchronicity grants advantage to Dexterity (Stealth) checks, since the target always finds a handy piece of cover available. Additionally, the target has advantage on all ability checks made to drive or pilot a vehicle.

In the event that two or more creatures under the effect of Synchronicity are attempting to avoid being inconvenienced by each other, the creatures engage in a contest of Charisma each time the effects of the spells would oppose each other.

### WIRE WALK

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 10 feet
- Components: V
- Duration: Instantaneous
This spell instantly transports up to six willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range to the location of a telephone you call. The telephone must be answered (either by a creature or by an answering machine), and it works only over an open line. You arrive adjacent to the device (within 5 feet of it), and any other creatures transported by the spell appear next to you.

### ZOMBIE PLAGUE
7th level necromancy

- Casting Time: 1 hour
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V S M (a crystal or jeweled skull worth 100,000₵, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: 1 day
- Classes: Cleric, Wizard
You lift high the skull you use for the material component. The skull’s eyes light up, it laughs, then shatters into dust which swirls into up to 10 Small or Medium humanoid corpses you can see within range. Each corpse immediately stands up and becomes a zombie.

When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be seen as friendly by the zombies. The zombies will move to attack any undesignated creatures they can see or hear. If the zombies detect no creatures in the area, they will move to explore in a random direction until they find creatures to attack.

Any humanoid killed by the zombies will also become a zombie under the effect of the spell after 1 minute. When the spell ends, the zombies immediately die.

If you cast this spell again before the end of its duration, you can extend the duration of the spell by amount of time equal to the spell's duration.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level, the duration is 1 week. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the duration is 1 month.
