# Profession System
In Astra Genesis you take on the role of a adventurer trekking across the stars, you are not heroes per se but some people may consider you as such. These Adventurers are called Starstrider. Starstriders do the work that must get done in the galaxy, even if no one wants to talk about it. Bounty hunting, murder for hire, corporate espionage, smuggling, piracy, all of these and more are done by Astra Genesis every moment of every day throughough the known galaxy.

You are one of those Starstriders. But who were you *before* you becamse a furious Android Barbarian, or cunning Rogue?

> Game Designer: To be clear. Class only advances by Milestone. The Profession system ***COMPLETELY*** replaces the skill system in 5e. This system has some cross over. Your attribute modifier and your Proficiency modifer do play a role in your skills by giving you a greater margin for error in your rolls. 

Your profession is often separate from your Class. A class represents combat training. Your profession represents what your characters professional training.

Put simply: Class comes into play in Ground Combat just following 5e rules. Profession comes into play outside combat more skill based (and also starship combat).

> Game Designer: 
> 
> Advantage. If something says you get Advantage on a skill check you roll an additional d20 
> 
> Disadvantage. If something says you get Disadvantage on a skill check you take away a d20.
> 
> Expertise. If something says you get Expertise such as a Rogue you apply your Proficiency modifier twice as usual.
> 
> Jack of All Trades. Works nearly exactly as it does in 5e. Normally you cannot add your proficiency modifier to skills without being proficient. In Astra Genesis you are proficient (at least 1) in all six disciplines, with Jack of All Trades you can add half rounded down minimum 1 to your skill checks in addition to your other modifiers
> 
> Reliable Talent. Works exactly like it does in 5e you cannot roll lower than a 9. However a roll of a 1 on a D20 is still a complication (see new rules.)

## Step 0: Intro
Lets do your attributes. They all start at 10. You will have points to spend later for now lets progress from here

## Step 1: Your species
You already chose your species. Your traits come from your species. They apply as Broad focuses (more in new rules). 

- Apply your species bonuses to your stats. 

## Step 2: Childhood
- Eventually something cool will happen here
- Create 1 Value
- For now spend 3 attribute points, nothing higher than 17.

## Step 3: Environment
- Eventually something cool will happen here
- Create 1 Value
- For now spend 3 attribute points, nothing higher than 17.

## Step 4: Backgrounds
Write down whatever label you want for your background. Fold it into your backstory. Were you Orphaned as a child? Put that in there and pick skills that make sense for an Orphaned Child. Work with your gamemaster. The removal of "Background Features" is replaced by the addition of a FEAT. 

- Eventually something cool will happen here
- For now spend 3 attribute points, nothing higher than 17.
* You get a Feat choice do this after you finish Step 6.
* Pick 3 Focuses
* Create 1 Value

> Game Designer: What do 5th Edition backgrounds all have in common? No one cares. I have played 5th edition since its inception and DM'd over 2000 hours of it and I have almost never seen someone *use* their background feature. But feats like Lucky? Every day.

## Step 5: Professional Development
Profesional development represents what career your character had (and in some cases may still do). If there is not one that suits your character vision work with your gamemaster to make one. While there is not one for Rimworld Lawkeeper or a Computer Slicer, your gamemaster could definitely assist you in coming up with what that looks like.

- Spend your final 3 attribute points here. Nothing higher than a 17 and nothing lower than a 10.
- All 6 disciplines start at 1, you get 10 points to spend and nothing can be higher than 5.
- Pick 3 Focuses
- Create 1 Value
- Gain 1 Contact or 1 Free Language


### Step 6: Final Checks
- You should have 75 attributes. Nothing should be higher than a 17 and nothing should be lower than 10.
- You have 16 in your skills with nothing higher than 5 and nothing lower than 1.
- You should have 4 Values
- You should have 6 Focuses
- You should have 1 Contact or 1 Free Language
- You should have racial traits, and a trait from your class
- You have 1 feat to pick.

Pick your Feat. This could raise an attribute to 18 which is fine now.

## Traits
You typically have 2 of these (Species and Class). Occasionally you can get others like Rank or Position such as Starship Captain.

Traits are very broad Values. It covers the fact that you should know your language, history, and background of your species without needing to spend anything. It also covers situations where being a Species or a Specific class can be invoked either for your benefit or against you.

## Values
You have 4 of these.

A value is a core concept, or cornerstone of your character. In 5e these were Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws. They almost never serve a purpose so they are replaced in Astra Genesis with Values. Written as a guideline about your character they come into play using Heroism later. Values are neutral they can be for you and against you.

# Skills

Making a skill check

- Roll xd20. (Typically 2d20 somthing 1d20 with disadvantage and sometimes 3d20 with advantage)
- Each d20 gets your Attribute modifier + Discipline Rating + Proficiency Modifier + Misc Bonuses add to it
- The standard DC in Astra Genesis (called Baseline is 20) you compare each dice against 20 if you met or exceeded 20 you got a success
- If you rolled a 20 you automatically get 2 success
- If you rolled a 1 you get a complication (more on that in New Rules) regardless of the total (though you may still succeed)

> Game Designer: Why multiple d20 and a weird success system and not 1d20? Because I want to. "Some men master Wayne like to watch the world burn"

## Skill Points By Level

You will gain 1 skill point when you gain a proficiency bonus. Remember no skill can exceed 5. And no discipline can be less than 1.

| Level | Skill Points |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 1     | 16           |
| 2     | 16           |
| 3     | 16           |
| 4     | 16           |
| 5     | 17           |
| 6     | 17           |
| 7     | 17           |
| 8     | 17           |
| 9     | 18           |
| 10    | 18           |
| 11    | 18           |
| 12    | 18           |
| 13    | 19           |
| 14    | 19           |
| 15    | 19           |
| 16    | 19           |
| 17    | 20           |
| 18    | 20           |
| 19    | 20           |
| 20    | 20           |

This means at 17 you could have 3 of your disciplines at 5, 2 at 2 and 1 at 1. Or however you want to spread them around.

> What about languages man?
>
> Languages work just like 5e. They are proficiencies. There are feats for this. But the Galaxy has Universal Translators so they are less important than they used to be.

### Skill Ratings
| Rating | Meaning                                                                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0      | Untrained, unskilled, lacking in innate aptitude                                                 |
| 1      | Basic training, rudimentary skill, or a raw but undeveloped aptitude.                            |
| 2      | Professional competence, from a combination of training and talent.                              |
| 3      | Experienced and well-trained, or an aptitude developed through study and training.               |
| 4      | Excellence within the field, achievable through dedication and experience.                       |
| 5      | Exceptional, often a combination of intense training, hard-won experience, and natural aptitude. |

> Why only 6 skills? 

> When I started off writing this system I had about 40 skills, they got trimmed to 25. As we play tested it became obvious several things with spending skill points meant you were going to default to your Discipline alot. If you could add your proficiency modifier to your disciplines ... well then you had 36 possible permutations because Disciplines were not attacked to a specific skill. Suddenly the game became so much more free and open. The player could make Social + Physical tests for Intimidation, they could make Technical + Dexterity checks to pick a lock and Technical + Intelligence checks to bypass a keypad lock. They could use Social + Intelligence to blend in with a science team for espionage and use Social + Charisma to be charming enough to talk the bartender into letting them upstairs. They were no longer **locked** into the concept of Attribute + Skill. It became collaborative, as gamemaster I would give a check and on occasion the player would say "I am thinking of doing it this way" and I would change the Discipline or the Attribue involved. 


## Focuses
You have 6 of these.

Each skill represents a somewhat broad area, a focus allows you to narrow that down and give a specific area that your character has knowledge in. Having an applicapble Focus for a skill check will provide you with Advantage to the roll if you already have Advantage this does not apply, if you have Disadvantage it counters that and makes the roll straight. 

> Keep in mind Advantage adds a d20 and Disadvantage takes it away.

## Disciplines
The six disciplines (Mental, Phyiscal, Observational, Operational, Social and Technical) represent very broad categories of education, training, and natural talent. Your rating in this discipline represents a broad area of education, training, natural aptitude, and capabilities. While it might feel limiting having only 6 Disciplines, when you have 6 Attrbiutes that get mix and matched with them frequently it broadens the horizon much more than traditional 5e Attribute locked skills. With the concept of multiple success it defines difficulty having a fixed Difficulty number

## Progression
As your character levels you gain the following benefits.

- 1 Discipline rating each time your profiency modifier goes up (5,9,13,17) to apply to a Discipline
- You can swap out Focuses
- You can move 1 discipline rating around. Never anything higher than 5 or lower than 1.
- The additional benefits of leveling up in your class.
- **IF** you invoked or were compelled to use a Value during that level you can change Values or evolve them.
