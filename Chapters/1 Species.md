## Drakneri 
Drakneri look very much like the dragons they evolved from standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first drakneri had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.

The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some drakneri clans. These drakneri often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.

## Enox

The flexible snouts augmented the enox finely tuned olfactory senses, collecting and filtering the air.

## Gelatin
(geLatin like Angle)

Gelatin are amorphous beings with no typical shape. In the presence of other folk, they often adopt a similar shape, but there’s little chance of mistaking a gelatin for anything else. They consume food by osmosis, the way an amoeba does, and excrete waste through tiny pores. They breathe by absorbing oxygen through another set of pores, and their limbs are strong and flexible enough to grasp and manipulate weapons and tools. Although most gelatin are translucent gray, they can alter their color and translucence by absorbing dyes through their pores.

Gelatin don’t have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves. These nerves enable a gelatin to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations. Gelatin can stiffen the outer layers of their bodies to maintain a humanlike shape, so they can wear clothing and accessories. They speak by forcing air out of tubular cavities that constrict to produce sound.

When gelatin sleep, they lose their rigidity and spread out and are thus sometimes mistaken for a rock or some other feature of the environment.

## Gnomes
A gnome’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome’s insatiable interest in everything around.

A gnome’s personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome’s beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points.

## Sovreki

Their dismal swamp homes might lie hundreds of light years from the nearest human colony, but the gap between their way of thinking and that of the smooth-skins is far greater.
