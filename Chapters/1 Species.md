## Gelatin
(geLatin like Angle)

Gelatin are amorphous beings with no typical shape. In the presence of other folk, they often adopt a similar shape, but there’s little chance of mistaking a gelatin for anything else. They consume food by osmosis, the way an amoeba does, and excrete waste through tiny pores. They breathe by absorbing oxygen through another set of pores, and their limbs are strong and flexible enough to grasp and manipulate weapons and tools. Although most gelatin are translucent gray, they can alter their color and translucence by absorbing dyes through their pores.

Gelatin don’t have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves. These nerves enable a gelatin to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations. Gelatin can stiffen the outer layers of their bodies to maintain a humanlike shape, so they can wear clothing and accessories. They speak by forcing air out of tubular cavities that constrict to produce sound.

When gelatin sleep, they lose their rigidity and spread out and are thus sometimes mistaken for a rock or some other feature of the environment.
