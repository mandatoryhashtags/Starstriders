# New Astra Genesis Rules
These rules typically only apply to outside of tactical combat which uses fairly standard 5e rules. This is written from a GM perspective but anyone can read it to know how these systems work.

## Heroism
Heroism is a currency in the Astra Genesis game. Each session you begin with Zero Heorism. You are encouraged to use them because you will lose them. You can earn them from action in a session but at the end of the session they are all lost. Whenever a character attempts a Task and scores a greater number of successes than the Difficulty, then these excess successes become Heroism, a valuable resource that allows characters to complete the Task more quickly or more thoroughly than normal, or otherwise gain additional benefits. Each success above and beyond the Difficulty of a Task becomes one point of Heorism, which the character may use immediately, may save for later, or some mixture of the two.

### Spending Heroism
The normal use for Heroism is to improve the outcome of a successful Task, such as gaining more information from research, inflicting more damage with an attack, or making more progress with an ongoing problem.

Immediately after determining if a Task is successful, the GM will describe the basic outcome of that Task. Heroism may then be spent to improve this outcome, or provide other benefits. Heroism used in this way doesn’t need to be declared in advance, and each point can be spent one at a time as required. For example, a character may see how much damage an attack has inflicted before spending Heroism to inflict more. Thus, Heroism can’t be wasted by being used on something that wasn’t necessary.

Most uses for Heroism can only be used once on any given Task, or once in any given Round in combat. Some Heroism spends are noted as being repeatable, which means that they can be used as frequently as the character wishes and as the Heroism available to spend on them. Once the character’s Task has been resolved, any unspent Heroism is added to the their pool; Heroism that cannot be added to the their pool is lost if it isn’t spent.

- **CREATE OPPORTUNITY(Repeatable, varies)**. You can buy additional d20s for checks/tasks at the cost of Heroism but no more than 3 this way
  - 1st d20: 1 Heorism
  - 2nd d20: 2 Heorism
  - 3rd d20: 3 Heroism
- **OBTAIN INFORMATION (Repeatable, 1)**. Heroism from a successful Task allows a character to learn more about a situation. Each point of Heroism spent can be used to ask the Gamemaster a single question about the current situation, or an item, object, structure, creature, or character present in or relevant to the scene at hand. The Gamemaster must answer this question truthfully, but the Gamemaster does not have to give complete information — a partial or brief answer that leaves room for further questions is more common. The information provided must be relevant to the Task attempted, and it must be the kind of information that a character using that skill would be able to determine in that situation — a character could use Observational to diagnose an illness, or Mental to identify a form of ranged weapon from the damage it causes.
- **CREATE AN ADVANTAGE(2)** Heroism can allow a character to produce a positive or advantageous circumstance. Spending **two Heroism** establishes some new Advantage in addition to whatever effect the successful Task had. Advantages created must relate to the nature of the Task attempted, and it must be something that could logically result from the character’s actions. This may instead be used to remove a Complication currently in play, or to create a Complication on an adversary. This can be as simple as "We brought rope in our packs to cross the Ravine (a complication), or in combat (even 5e combat) it can give you the 5e definition of Advantage (a re-roll take the highest) or counter Disadvantage making the roll straight.

### Earning Heorism
- Rolling more successes than you need on skill checks
- You can buy Heroism for Threat.
- All Heroism goes away at the end of a scene

## Invoking a Value
This is a unique thing to do. Each game session every player begins with the ability to *Invoke a Value*. Invoking a value has several possible benefits but this is an extremely potent ability and can only be done once per game session. This replaces the D&D Inspiration system. 

Uses:
- Perfect Opportunity. You find a perfect opportunity and exploit it. You declare which value applies that causes this opportunity and in doing so you get a free d20 that has already rolled a 20 thus giving you 2 Successes in a Task or a Critical Hit in combat.
- Re-Roll. You declare which value applies that causes this opportunity and in doing so you get to re-roll all of the dice you just rolled but you must keep the second roll.

Once this has been done it cannot be done again that game session unless the Gamemaster tells you that you may now use another invocation. 

## Traits/Advantages/Complications
Traits, Advantages, and Complications form a system that assists you while framing a scene, by highlighting the circumstances that may affect characters, benefit them, and also hinder their actions. Traits can do a number of things and a good mix is vital to establishing a scene that characters can navigate effectively.

### Traits

Traits that aren’t inherently advantageous or complicate the scene have the potential to do both, depending on the characters present and the Tasks they want to attempt. Traits will either present the characters with an Advantage, present them with a Complication, or not affect the scene in this circumstance. As Gamemaster, you have the final say in whether they affect the Task or not.

Traits can last for a number of scenes, Rounds or even over several game sessions and their impact may have lasting impact on the characters. They can be introduced either when you are framing a scene (establishing its circumstances and therefore its Traits), through spending 2 Threat points when a scene or encounter is already in play, or by a character through spending Heroism or Threat. Traits should last for as long as they are applicable, but don’t necessarily change or go away just because the story moves away from a location and come back later — a planet’s atmosphere doesn’t change much in the lifespans of most species, so a Trait linked to a planet’s atmosphere will appear as many times as the Player Characters are there.

Traits are broken up into several types, denoting where they show up. Situation Traits tend to only be temporary, while location Traits will come up every time the Players visit that place, and a personal or species Trait reflects a certain character, particularly Non-Player Characters. These types should tell you in what circumstances they come up. Location Traits may affect all Tasks in the area, while character Traits will only affect certain interactions with one character.

Particularly potent Traits may be indicated by a number after them. A “Hazardous Atmosphere 2” Trait will mean it increases Difficulties by 2 rather than just 1 and may even make most Tasks impossible to accomplish without an appropriate Advantage. It essentially counts as two identical Traits, rather than one.

### Advantages
Advantages are Traits that are inherently advantageous to characters and will only ever provide a benefit. Advantages come about mostly from equipment, Heroism spends, or Threat spends in the case of NPCs. They reduce difficulties for characters attempting Tasks the Advantage relates to or make that Task possible where it normally wouldn’t have been. Advantages can be shared, as either a new location or situation Trait, or can be personal to a character as a Character Trait. Remember you can always spend Threat just as Players spend Heroism, creating Advantages for your NPCs during a scene or encounter. Advantages can never be used as a Complication, against a character — they are only helpful.

### Complications
Complications are Traits that get in the way or complicate a character’s Tasks. They either increase a Task’s difficulty or make it impossible where normally it would have been possible. Complications allow for creative additions or changes to your scenes and is the type of Trait the Gamemaster has most agency over during play. For example, an engineer might succeed in their task but blow out some power relays, blocking them off from their crewmates. In essence, this creates a new obstacle for the Player Characters. Combined with incoming enemies, it could make for an interesting encounter. Alternatively, it could be saved for later. But Complications aren’t as powerful as spending a lot of Threat, and Players should be able to overcome those setbacks with a Task or a short Challenge.

You can also increase the Complication range of a Task, given the circumstances of the scene or the Task. By increasing the Complication range you give more possibility to a Complication arising, letting you either bank two Threat or create a Complication for that Player Character.

## Threat
Threat provides a unique mechanic to raise the stakes of the scene, encounter, or even the entire mission. It allows you to increase the Difficulty, provide Complications, and change the scene in your favor.

The Gamemaster begins every session with two Threat for each Player at the table. This allows you to have a pool of Threat available at the beginning of the game, but you will also gain Threat in the following ways:

**Immediate Heroism**: Whenever the character uses an Immediate Heroism Spend — such as to buy bonus d20s — they normally choose to pay that cost in Heroism from the group’s pool. However, the character may instead choose to pay some or all that cost by adding one point of Threat to the pool for each point of Heroism that would otherwise have been spent.

**Complications**: When a character suffers one or more Complications on a Task, they or the Gamemaster may choose not to have the Complication take effect, in exchange for adding two to the Threat pool.

**Threatening Circumstances**: The environment or circumstances of a new scene may be threatening enough to warrant adding one or two Threat to the pool automatically. Similarly, some Non-Player Characters — this will be listed in their rules — may generate Threat just for turning up, in response to circumstances, or by taking certain actions. This also includes activities that escalate the tensions of the scene, such as Player Characters using deadly force. If it has Legendary Actions - it causes threat for each Legendary Action Point.

**Non-Player Character Heroism**: Non-Player Characters with unspent Heroism cannot save it as Player characters can — Non-Player Characters don’t have a group Heroism pool. Instead, a Non- Player Character can spend Heroism to add to Threat, adding one Threat for each Heroism spent (Repeatable).

When you are framing a scene, it is up to you which Traits you establish affecting how the Player Characters will interact with the scene. Once the scene is underway, the only way to change those circumstances is the use of Threat, or through the actions of Non-Player Characters.

**This is very important: any change the Gamemaster wishes to make to circumstances once a scene has begun must come from either a Non-Player Character or from spending Threat.**

You could bring in reinforcements during an encounter, or increase the difficulty of curing a virus, but Threat really comes into its own when used as a creative tool to completely change the circumstances the Player Characters find themselves in. From plot twists to unexpected events, Threat can be used to create a shift in the dramatic conflict. You could spend that five Threat to bring in five more Orc warriors, but what if, instead, the klaxons on board suddenly sounded “Self-destruct sequence initiated, silent countdown begun...” The encounter has changed completely and the Player Characters need to decide how to act next.

Threat also relies on an economy with the Players at the table, as well as the Threat your Non-Player Characters generate through their own ‘Heroism’. Remember that Players can always pay for their Create Opportunity Heroism spend with Threat. You may also wish to bank two Threat instead of implementing a Complication from a Player’s dice roll.

It’s especially effective when the way the Gamemaster spends Threat has a clear tie to the way Threat was generated in a scene. If the scene says there’s an alarm panel, then a Non-Player Character activating that panel may add to Threat, and then that Threat can naturally be used to bring in reinforcements, creating a sense of cause and effect. This approach can be helpful for making Threat seem like a natural part of the process, rather than something abrupt or intrusive.

### Threat Spends
**Non-Player Character Heroism**. The Threat pool serves as a mirror for the Players’ group Heroism pool. Thus, Non-Player Characters may use Threat in all the ways that Player Characters use group Heroism.

**Non-Player Character Threat Spends**. For any action or choice where a Player Character would add one or more points to Threat, a Non-Player Character performing that same action or choice must spend the equivalent number of points of Threat.

**Non-Player Character Complications**. If a Non-Player Character suffers a Complication, the Gamemaster may prevent the Complication by spending two Threat.

**Complication**. The Gamemaster may create a Complication by spending two Threat.

**Reinforcements**. The Gamemaster may bring in additional Non-Player Characters during a scene. Minor Non-Player Characters cost one Threat apiece, while Notables cost two. Starship reinforcements cost Threat equal to their Scale.

**Environmental Effects**. The Gamemaster may trigger or cause problems with the environment by spending Threat.

**Reversal**. The Gamemaster may end a scene or encounter prematurely, with the situation unresolved, by spending two Threat for each Player Character present in that scene or encounter. The Gamemaster describes the manner in which the situation escalates or deteriorates in a major way — such as large numbers of enemy reinforcements, or some other imminent catastrophe — and then ends the scene. This cannot be used to harm or kill the player characters directly, only to radically change their circumstances, and the Players should be given a few moments to discuss their new situation before the Gamemaster sets a new scene (either with those characters, or, to raise the tension, with other characters elsewhere).

## Values
Values form the fundamental aspect of a character’s beliefs and personality. They define who the Player Characters are and how they react in any given situation. While Players can use Heroism to **invoke** these values for an automatic success, it gives them a framework to roleplay by, you as the Gamemaster can use those Values against a Player Character, giving them the option of accepting a Complication.

Citing a Value to develop a Complication for a Player uses the character’s beliefs against them to develop drama and a mechanical disadvantage within the mission. If a character Value would ever mean that the character would not act as the Player intends or if it brings up dramatic conflict because of the circumstances, then present the Player with a decision:

The Player Character can either:
- Accept a Complication about their Value and receive 2 points of Heroism
- Decline the Complication granting the Gamemaster 2 Threat

If the Player accepts the Complication, then it could change the scene in one of the following ways: 

Increase the difficulty of Tasks relating to that Complication or make certain Tasks impossible. In this instance, a Complication may take the form of prohibiting a certain course of action. Complications relating to Values are always personal and don’t affect other characters. This could mean that the Player Character finds it more difficult to attempt Tasks relating to that Value or simply won’t attempt them at all.

Players should always should be aware of the consequences of accepting it: they should know the nature of the Complication they’re accepting before they choose to accept it. It is important that Players feel a sense of agency — being able to control their character’s actions — and inhibiting them from certain actions may halt the game. Ultimately, Complications of this nature should add drama to a scene or encounter and shouldn’t unnecessarily stop Players from acting as they wish.

Players may wish to challenge the Value that caused them Complications, based on what happened on the mission in which it was invoked against them, which should be encouraged as it lets their character grow and develop, adapting to their circumstances and experiences. This ties directly to a primary tenet of roleplaying, that the people of the setting are dedicated to lifelong learning, discovery, and self-improvement.

### Directives
Directives are a great way to introduce mission specific Values to your game. One Directive is always in play, the Prime Directive, where “No interference with the social development of said planet...” is paramount to all other mission considerations. While this Directive is always in play, it is sometimes worth highlighting to characters before they engage in their mission or certain actions. Other Directives may come into play based on the mission or at your discretion. 

Players have access to all of these Directives at any time, and can call upon them to use Determination and even challenge them to gain points of Determination. The repercussions of challenging them would be up to you at the end of the mission. Equally, you may use any Directive to introduce a Complication for the characters, persuading them to act in a certain way depending on Alliance’s wishes.

Directives are for you to set, or may be present in pre-written mission supplements, and should reflect the ethos of the mission or the orders given by Alliance Command. Those Directives could remain for one mission, or could form a continuing yard stick by which the crew measures how they act during their on-going missions out on the Final Frontier.


## Extended Tests
Extended Tasks provide a greater challenge for the Player Characters than normal Tasks. While Tasks represent attempting to resolve a problem with one approach and in a short amount of time, Extended Tasks give the Gamemaster the opportunity to present problems that require a longer amount of time and greater degree of work to resolve while there is pressure on the characters to achieve the Task. They can be Tasks that last a whole game session, or even extend over several sessions, and often provide slow mounting tension or much more active problem solving from the Players around the table.

Extended Tasks should only be introduced where there is a definitive pressure on the Player Characters to achieve the Task; that ultimately provides excitement and drama. The following suggestions can provide a pacing mechanism rather than a measure of difficulty — they make the Extended Task longer to complete and the tension should increase because there is some peril or problem that worsens the longer they take.

Consequences: The Extended Task itself is risky, with potential consequences either for failed Tasks, or for Complications that occur during attempted Tasks. These consequences may involve damage, or other lingering problems that make it unwise to make too many attempts.

Limited Attempts: The Extended Task can only be attempted a set number of times, normally equal to the Magnitude, or one lower than the Magnitude, depending on how problematic the Extended Task is meant to be (less is more problematic). If the number of attempts are used up without the Extended Task being completed, then the characters suffer some manner of consequence.

Peril: The Extended Task takes place amongst some persistent peril or hazard. This might be a constantly- hostile environment (such as a barely-breathable atmosphere, extreme temperatures, or some other environment that will have a constant effect), or an environment that presents a risk (such as being on the hull of the ship wearing an environment suit, where a suit breach or being knocked away could prove disastrous). If there’s a constant peril, the characters suffer a small amount of damage or a Complication with each attempted Task (see Damage, Injury, and Recovery, later), making it dangerous to spend too long attempting the Task. If there’s a risky environment, each attempted Task adds one point to Threat, which the Gamemaster may spend to turn that potential for risk into actual danger.

Time Pressure: The Extended Task must be completed within a set amount of time, and exceeding this time limit either makes it impossible to progress or results in some severe consequence. At the start of the Extended Task, the Gamemaster determines the number of Intervals that the Extended Task must be completed within, and how long a period that each Interval represents (ten minutes, an hour, a day, etc.). The ideal number of Intervals is about 2-3 times the Extended Task’s Magnitude, with a smaller number of Intervals resulting in more time pressure on the characters. The Gamemaster should also determine what happens when Time runs out — this should be a severe consequence. Each Task attempted takes two Intervals, though this can be reduced to one by spending two Heroism on a successful Task, and/or increased by one for each Complication suffered (instead of the Complications’ normal effects).

Extended Tasks have several considerations when framing them for Players. You should build your Extended Tasks with the following in mind, and be cautious about when to implement them.

### WORK
The Work Track of an Extended Task is a number from five to twenty, which Players progress along depending on the totals scored on Challenge Dice. Progress can be an indication of how much time is required to resolve the Extended Task or how complex the problem is, but care is required when framing this within a mission. If the Extended Task is not of much importance for the ongoing story, but is required in the session, then consider giving it a low Work Track value, between five and ten. Only Extended Tasks that provide genuine tension to Player’s engagement with the plot of the mission, or are imperative to resolve the conflict at hand, should be given longer Work Tracks.

There is a danger that longer Extended Tasks could become tedious, as a lot of smaller Tasks and Challenge Dice rolls are required to resolve them, particularly if luck is not on the Players’ side. You should always keep in mind the dramatic situation at hand, narrating how progress is being made, rather than relying on the dice and the mechanics to tell the story. How does one success differ from another? How does the character’s approach or Discipline being used inform the progress? Are there any specific approaches that should be especially effective, giving the character extra benefits for Effects rolled on their ?

### MAGNITUDE
The Magnitude of an Extended Task represents how large and complex the Task is, and also provides the Players with the number of Breakthroughs they require. Magnitudes of one or two should be used when a problem or project isn’t very complex or outside the normal remit for the characters. Greater Magnitudes of three to five represent very complex problems or situations with newly discovered phenomena or unusual circumstances. Like the difficulty of normal Tasks, environmental factors or adverse situations may increase the Magnitude by one or two steps, but the Gamemaster should be careful making increases, as repeated Tasks at a difficulty at 3 or more will drain Players’ resources or give you Threat based on their choices. Difficulty can always be increased or reduced through Advantages or Complications.

### BREAKTHROUGHS
A Breakthrough represents success in an Extended Task, a point in the scene or encounter where the Player characters both make some progress toward resolving the problem and gain some insight into its nature. Breakthroughs will occur when the Players roll well, when their characters do good work on the problem at hand, or at the end of the Work track when a lot of work has already been done. Breakthroughs early on could be eureka moments, maybe providing the Player characters with some insight into what actions are having the most effect. In a mechanical sense, it reduces the difficulty by 1. A Breakthrough may also award them additional Heroism in future Tasks relating to this Extended Task or give them a better idea of which Disciplines would be more appropriate or useful. Breakthroughs when the Work track is full come from a lot of work already being done on solving the problem at hand and so the results ride on the progress already carried out.

Every 5 Work = 1 Breakthrough

### RESISTANCE
Resistance should be reserved for the most arduous of Extended Tasks, where obstacles have been placed in the way of the characters by opposing forces, or where environmental factors make progress particularly difficult. Resistance will make the Extended Task longer, so only use it where necessary to the dramatic tension, or as the actions of the Non-Player Characters or situation make things more difficult. Heroism spent by the Players can reduce this value; this can be made sense of dramatically by the characters finding a way around the difficult factor or succeeding at their Task in such a way that it mitigates the obstruction of their attempts.

### COMPLICATIONS
When Complications come up in Extended Tasks, they have ramifications for the Work or Resistance of the Task. Narratively this could come down to a number of reasons, such as technology overloading or breaking down due to adaptation, gaffes in political situations, or biology or naturally occurring phenomena adapting to the characters’ actions. Complications from Extended Tasks don’t usually carry over into the story as a whole unless absolutely appropriate.

### PERIL AND TIME
It may be that the Extended Task occurs without constraints on time or without an imminent danger, but, while framing the Extended Task, the Gamemaster should consider the situation around the Task. It may be that the Players only have a certain amount of time to complete their attempts to resolve the problem; meaning limited attempts should be placed on the Players’ Tasks, related to the Magnitude. Or the Extended Task may be attempted around an immediate peril or during conflict, in which case the Magnitude may be greater or characters may take damage from attempts or Complications. Framing an Extended Task within a perilous scene or encounter will build the tension and make the Tasks exciting for the Players.


An Extended Task also has a base Difficulty, which is used for all Tasks made to overcome the Extended Task. This base Difficulty can be modified on each Task as circumstances (such as Traits) dictate, but they all start from the same place.

Whenever a character succeeds at a Task to overcome an Extended Task, there are a few additional steps to follow over and above the normal procedure for completing a Task.

The character rolls 2d2, plus additional d2 equal to the Discipline used for that Task. The total rolled on these dice is the amount of Work done.

A. If five or more Work is made, after reduction for Resistance, the character also achieves a Breakthrough.

B. If the Work track is filled, or if one or more Work is made after reduction for Resistance, when the Work track was already full, the character achieves a Breakthrough.

If the number of Breakthroughs achieved is equal to the Extended Task’s Magnitude, the Extended Task is complete. Otherwise, the base Difficulty of the Extended Task is reduced by one for each Breakthrough achieved, to a minimum of 0. If the base Difficulty has already been reduced to 0, each subsequent Breakthrough adds +1d2 to any future rolls for Work on this Extended Task.

- Work Force: 5-20
- Magnitude: 1-5
- Difficulty: 5-25
- Resistance: 0-3
- Test: The skill test required
- Interval: How long each test takes

The testing character makes their test if they are successful they roll Xd2 where X is the number of ranks in the relevant skill. Total the D2 (called challenge dice) together and subtract the resistance if there is any. Anything left over is applied directly to the Work Force. For every 5 work force applied; you get 1 Progress. When the Progress equals the Magnitude the test is successful. These should be used somewhat sparingly but they can add drama to certain scenes. Resistance represents difficulties like working under stress, lack of proper tools etc.

## Difficulty
Astra Genesis has a default TN of 18.

Some things may make things easier or harder such as threat. But what defines difficulty is the number of successes needed. This ranges from 1-5 typically. Though some extreme challenges may have 6 or more

> I tend to write down their TN's at the start of the session for each Attribute.

## Rolling a 1
Is not a failure in itself but you do get a complication. If you add all your modifiers you may still get a success it will just cost you.

## Rolling a 20
Gives you 2 successes.

## Spell Points and Magic
This is covered in classes but outlined here as well. 

# Things unchanged
Anything not explicitely called out above works just like 5e. Saving Throws for example.
