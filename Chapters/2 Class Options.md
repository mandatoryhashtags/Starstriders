# Class Options

This game uses classes from the 5th Edition SRD.

In Starstrider very few people actually have classes, only the elite do. You are one of those, you are a Starstrider.

The following are Class Options for players that fit the setting. As a rule under each class is a list of Subclasses or Options that are common in the game. Anything outside this list would need approval from the Game master.

Spell Points: Full casters get their level in spell points x4, half casters (ranger, paladin) get their level x2, and 1/4 casters (Arcane Trickster, Eldritch fighter, Primal Monk) get their level in spell points. Warlocks are special cases where they get level x3

Cantrips: Are at will and cost no spell points

Spell Slots: These do not exist. If something says spell slots ignore it. Every spell costs its level +1 to cast. The restriction on 1 spell per day of 7th, 8th, and 9th level still applies from spell points they are taxing.

> Designer note. This means that your casters can cast a lot of spells. Your fighters than fire a lot of rockets and barbarians can throw a lot of grenades too. I have done away with vancian magic in favor of a mana based system.

### Pyrokinetic
Pyrokinetics are artificers that specializes on creating and controlling fire with their abilities and magic. Even though some people think they are dangerous individuals, there are several pirokinetics that use their abilities for extinguish hazardous fires that threaten life, property, and the environment as well as to rescue people from dangerous situations involving fires.

#### BONUS CANTRIPS
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you know the control flames and produce flame cantrips. These spells count as artificer cantrips for you, but you cannot replace them with another cantrip from the artificer spell list when you level up in this class.

#### PYROKINETIC SPELLS
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Pyrokinetic Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.


| ARTIFICER LEVEL | SPELL                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 3               | burning hands,fog cloud        |
| 5               | flaming sphere,scorching ray   |
| 9               | fireball,melf's minute meteors |
| 13              | fire shield, wall of fire      |
| 17              | flame strike, immolation       |

#### PYROKINETIC AMPLIFIER
Beginning at 3rd level, you can canalize and amplify your pyrokinetic abilities. Using Mechanic's kit, you can take an action to magically create a pair of flaming gauntlets or for imbuing a weapon with your arcane energy. You can use the pyrokinetic amplifier as a spellcasting focus, and you gain new features depending on what option you choose, which are detailed below.

- Gauntlets. You touch your forearms to create a pair of flaming gauntlets. You gain the following features:
- Armor of Embers. Whenever you take fire damage, you can use your reaction to generate a protective flaming shield that absorb part of that damage, reducing the fire damage by 1d4. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
- Burning Spells. When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, lightning, or thunder damage, you can change that damage type to fire.
- Weapon. You touch a weapon you're proficient, giving it a fiery aspect. While you're using that weapon, it gains the following features:
- Flaming Weapon. Whenever you hit with a weapon attack, the target takes an extra 1d4 fire damage. This fire damage count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity. The weapon can also ignite any flammable object that isn't being worn or carried.
- Critical Combustion. Each time you make a critical hit with your pyrokinetic amplifier weapon, the attack generates a fire explosion. After dealing the damage from the critical hit, the target and every other creature within 10 feet from it other than yourself must make Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Once you create a pyrokinetic amplifier, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell point(s) of 1st level or higher. You can have only one pyrokinetic amplifier at a time.

#### PYROMANCER
At 5th level, you are an expert on controlling and sensing the fire around you, fueling your spells and abilities with it. You gain the following features:

- Whenever you cast a spell using your pyrokinetic amplifier as the spellcasting focus, you deal an additional 1d8 fire damage.
- Additionally, you can spend 1 minute to focus on detecting heat and thermal signals in a 120 feet radius for a number of minutes equal to half your Artificer level (rounded up). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and it only gives you the general direction and intensity of the sources of heat, but not the type (like if it's a creature or an object) or the exact number of sources.

#### IMPROVED AMPLIFIER
Starting at 9th level, your pirokinetic amplifier is capable of canalize even more your arcane magic, granting the following changes to each type.

Gauntlets. The fire damage reduced by the armor of embers is now 1d8, and whenever you reduce damage with this feature, you are healed by the same amount.

Weapon. The extra fire damage the weapon deals is now 1d8 and your attacks using your pirokinetic amplifier weapon score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Additionally, you can spend a spell point(s) instead to use the critical combustion feature each time you hit a target with your weapon. The damage dealt from the critical combustion feature now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity.

#### MASTER OF THE FLAMES
Starting at 15th level, you have mastered the control of fire through your pyrokinetic abilities:

You gain resistance to fire damage.
You can cast conjure elemental (fire elemental only) and investiture of flame without expending a spell point(s), without preparing the spell, and without material components, provided you use your pyrokinetic amplifier as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.

### MECH PILOT
Mastery of the modern battlefield requires a hybrid approach of technology and magic, and no combat specialist epitomizes this approach better than the Mech Pilot. Armed and armored in an enchanted mobile suit, the battle mech is a flexible weapons platform built to be reconfigurable. This allows it to fit into any tactical situation on evolving battlefields.

The Mech Pilot’s bond to their battle mech is critical to their success. The battle mech is attuned to their pilot’s magic, and strong fluctuations of that power source can cause instability, desynchronization, and mission failure. However, a Mech Pilot with mind and mech united can become an unstoppable force.

#### MECH PILOT SPELLS
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Mech Pilot Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| ARTIFICER LEVEL | SPELLS                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 3rd             | magic missile, shield                   |
| 5th             | gust of wind, shatter                   |
| 9th             | lightning bolt, thunder step            |
| 13th            | fire shield, storm sphere               |
| 17th            | steel wind strike, teleportation circle |

#### BATTLE MECH
At 3rd level, your knowledge of arcane mechanics has allowed you to develop a sophisticated mechanical suit that you pilot into battle. Over the course of a long rest, you can use your Mechanic's kit to create a battle mech, which functions as a magical suit of medium armor. The armor weighs 200 pounds, which you can ignore while you wear it. The armor can be the target of one of your artificer infusions.

You gain the following benefits while wearing the battle mech:

- When you attack with a weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.
- You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
- You gain proficiency with all martial weapons.
- The armor is powered by your magic, and any creature other than you that dons the battle mech receives no benefits, they cannot use its properties, and the creature's movement speed becomes 0. The armor continues to be a battle mech until you creature another battle mech.

#### TACTICAL ASSAULT ARRAY
Also at 3rd level, you can adjust your armor for a given combat situation. When you create your battle mech, choose one of the following modes: hellion, valkyrie, or titan. The mode you choose gives you special benefits while you wear the battle mech, and determines its properties as armor per the Battle Mech Armor table.

You can change your battle mech’s mode whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have mechanics kit in hand.

| MODE     | ARMOR CLASS               | STEALTH      |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| Hellion  | 12 + Dex modifier         | -            |
| Valkyrie | 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) | -            |
| Titan    | 16                        | Disadvantage |

- (a) two shortblades or (b) any simple weapon

### Dreadnaught
You are a merciless, destructive and unstoppable force. When it comes to fighting, you are at the forefront. A dreadnought generally approach combat in the most direct way possible, rarely carrying only one gun and leaving a path of devastation behind. In the midst of battle, you are capable to take a great deal of punishment while dealing out far more to any who dares to go against you.

#### JUGGERNAUT
Starting when you select this path at 3rd level, when you are targeted by an attack or a spell while you're raging, you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to your rage damage until the beginning of your next turn.

Additionally, you gain advantage in saving throws against being knocked prone or moved against your will.

#### DRAW FIRE
At 6th level, you can use your reaction to distract opponents and convince them that you are the most dangerous target in the area. Choose one creature that you can see within 15 feet of you which is attacking one friendly creature. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC equals to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or attack you instead.

#### BODY GUARD
At 10th level, while you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. A creature is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.

#### DEVASTATING RAGE
At 14th level, when you have half or less hit points while raging, you can add your Rage Damage bonus to attack rolls.

### Street Savage
Heavy metal, rusty junkyard scrap, and a bad attitude all wrapped into one package. The Street Savage is one mean motherfucker who specializes in launching as much lead as possible at any stupid sonnofabitch that looks at you cross-eyed. Preferably from a monster truck.

More cunning than one might give them credit for, the Street Savage is adept at attaching all manner of brutal instruments to their weapons. Does this gatling gun need a chainsaw? Should I mount a rocket launcher on my flamethrower? When I die, should I go to hell with friends? The answer is always, “YES!”

#### WALKING TANK
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can leverage your ferocious strength and rage into your firearms. You gain the following benefits:

* When you attack with a heavy firearm (one that has a Strength requirement), you can use your Strength modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier for the attack roll.
* Where your Barbarian features apply to melee weapon attacks, they now also apply to ranged weapon attacks with heavy firearms.

#### SAVAGE ACCESSORIES
At 3rd level, you can modify your firearms to be more useful in brutal combat. You gain proficiency with Mechanic's kit and land or water vehicles (your choice). If you already have either of these proficiencies, you instead gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

Over the course of a long rest, you can add one of the following savage accessories to a two-handed, heavy firearm.

* Belt Feed. If this firearm lacks the blast property, it ignores the reload property.
* Blast Shield. While you are holding this weapon you are not affected by the blast property on weapons and you have resistance to thunder damage.
* Bola Launcher. As an attack with this firearm, you can launch a bola at a creature. A bola functions similarly to a net, except that it is range 20/60, and you can make your normal number of attacks. You can reload this launcher over the course of a short or long rest.
* Chainsaw. This weapon also functions as a chainsaw for melee attack purposes, including opportunity attacks, except that it does not require a pull start in order to be used.
* Dead Man’s Switch. You can attach an explosive that requires an action to use to this firearm. If you are holding the firearm when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can activate the explosive at a point within your space. You can replace the explosive over the course of a short or long rest.
* Grapple Harpoon. This weapon can launch a harpoon at a target. It functions similarly to a spear gun except that it is range 30/60. When you hit a creature with a harpoon from this weapon, and the target is a creature your size or smaller, you can make a contested Strength (Athletics) check to pull it next to you and grapple it with a free hand. If there is no open adjacent space, then the creature stops in the nearest available open space and is not grappled. Alternatively, if the target is larger than you, you can choose to be pulled to it. However, this does not grapple it.
* Under-Barrel Rocket Launcher. This weapon also functions as a rocket launcher. This accessory is not compatible with other under-barrel accessories.

A firearm can have only 1 savage accessory, and you can maintain a number of savage accessories equal to your Rage Damage. If you attempt to add a savage accessory beyond your limit, you can choose which of your current savage accessories will break and become unusable.

If a creature other than you attempts to use one of your savage accessories or the firearm it is attached to, the attempt will fail and the firearm will malfunction, causing the creature to take 2d4 slashing or piercing damage (your choice).

#### ROAD RAGE
At 6th level, you become a fierce road warrior who gives new meaning to the term muscle car. If you enter a rage while you are driving a vehicle, the benefits of your rage also apply to your vehicle until the rage ends.

Your rage doesn’t end early if your vehicle has attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since your last turn. While you are driving a vehicle and raging, the vehicle can make ranged attacks using your Strength modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack rolls.

Additionally, you can control a vehicle without having a free hand for the vehicle’s controls.

#### BLAZE OF GLORY
At 10th level, when a vehicle you are driving is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction to have the vehicle move up to its movement speed. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. If a vehicle would explode when it is reduced to 0 hit points, the explosion occurs immediately after this movement.


Additionally, you gain resistance to fire damage and you take no damage from explosion effects caused by a vehicle or any other object reaching 0 hit points.

#### DEATH MACHINE
Beginning at 14th level, your adrenaline fueled rage allows you to maintain an iron grip on two weapons of mass destruction simultaneously. While you’re raging, you can ignore the two-handed property on all firearms. As a bonus action, you can engage in two-weapon fighting with any firearm.

Additionally, you can draw or stow two firearms when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.

### BARD: COLLEGE OF ANARCHY
The College of Anarchy is less a place and more a state of mind. It is a rejection of oppressive governments, of soulless megacorporations, and of any shithead that wants to tell you what to do. It is a statement of revolution against ‘The Man’, and all it represents.

The bards of this college tend to be loud, in both voice and appearance. The image of the punk rocker with a colorful mohawk and glowing LED tattoos is iconic, but the seed of rebellion can take root in even the most forgettable of office workers.

This force of personality yearns to crack the pillars of civilization and cause everything to come crumbling down, but their motivation for doing so is their own.

As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration on a creature you can see or who can hear you other than yourself within 60 feet of you to use one of the following Rebellious Shout options of your choice. If the creature is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, the creature is not moved and suffers no effects.

* Rise Up. The creature regains hit points equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier and is pulled up to 10 feet closer to you. If the creature is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up. A creature cannot be the target of this ability again until they have finished a short or long rest.
* Fuck Off. The creature takes thunder damage equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier. If the creature is Large or smaller, it is pushed up to 10 feet away from you.
* Get Lost. The creature is frightened until the end of your next turn and is deafened for 1 minute.

#### REVOLUTION
At 6th level, you can speak up when you see someone being oppressed and harden their resolve. As a reaction, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes a saving throw against being frightened or charmed, you can start a performance per the Countercharm feature. The creature gains advantage on the saving throw as part of the performance.

#### LOUDSPEAKER
Starting at 14th level, the power of your voice is magnified to establishment-shattering levels. When you use your Rebellious Shout, you can also target creatures of your choice within 10 feet of your original target, and they are affected by your Rebellious Shout option.

Additionally, whenever any of your spells ends while using this feature, the creature or creatures affected don't realize they were charmed by you unless you want to.

#### UTTERLY CONVINCING
Starting at 14th level, when you make a Charisma-based ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add twice the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.

### COMMERCE DOMAIN
The gods of commerce oversee the trade of goods and services. These deities understand that business lubricates the gears of society and keeps everything running smoothly. Some gods see commerce as a force which must be regulated so that all may benefit from fair trade. Other gods see it as a competition, where the accrual of wealth and power are the goal. In the cutthroat world of megacorporations and massive economic inequality, the latter deities often hold greater sway.

Clerics of these gods put great stock in the open market and the true value of all things. A cleric’s station may range from the lowly accountant with dreams of starting their own business, to a ruthless mid-level executive looking to climb the ranks into the executive boardroom, or perhaps they're a rogue economist trying to bring balance to the commercial world.

| CLERIC LEVEL | SPELLS                                |

For each Hit Dice spent in this manner, the target adds 1d4 to the result. You can only use this ability after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

At 8th level, the attack bonus increases to +2

#### CITY GUARDIAN
At 10th level, you can wild shape into a city guardian for 1 minute. After using this feature, you must finish a long rest to use it again. You can find the statistics of the city guardian later in this supplement.

#### TRUE CONSTRUCT
At 14th level, you cannot be charmed, paralyzed, petrified or poisoned and you are immune to poison and psychic damage. Additionally, you can wild shape into a city guardian twice before a long rest.

### CIRCLE OF TRANSFORMATION
Though the forests have been replaced by cities, the trees replaced by glittering steel spires, and the wayward paths replaced by neon-stained streets, some things never change. The land may look different, but those who look for a heart in the concrete jungle will find it beating to the rhythm of a combustion engine. Through the streets flows the blood of the city, a ceaseless tide of machines and life.

Where lovers of nature would give up and abandon these lands for greener pastures, others would appreciate the splendor of chrome and grime. The streets and skyscrapers have a will of their own, and a voice for those who will listen. They were paved and built with purpose, and those that would speak for the city shall know the strength in its foundations.

After all, in worlds both natural and artificial, one rule reigns supreme: survival of the fittest. Where clumsy beasts would be out of their element, druids of this circle shall find themselves at home. Where paw and hoof dare not tread, let wheels roll instead.

#### METAL BEAST
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action, and you gain proficiency with Mechanic's kit.

Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend 2 spell slpointsot to increase your speed by 10 feet per level of the spell expended until the end of your current turn.

#### ALL-TERRAIN FORMS
The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into a variety of vehicles. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a sentient vehicle with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 4. For example, at 2nd level, you can transform into a vehicle with a challenge rating of 1/2, such as a motorcycle or jet ski.

When you transform, your vehicle form can have a melee weapon mount installed (you choose the type), per the vehicle modification (see Chapter 4). You can use your proficiency bonus instead of the vehicle's when making attacks with this weapon. You don't gain any of the vehicle's immunity to conditions.

You ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there. All creatures are treated as the same size as you for the purposes of determining crashing damage. If your form has an explosion effect when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you are not damaged by your explosion.

#### MYSTIC MUNITIONS
Starting at 6th level, your attacks in vehicle form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Additionally, when you transform into a Large or larger vehicle, you can have a ranged weapon mount installed with a gatling gun, assault cannon, or rocket launcher, per the vehicle modification. Ammunition for these weapons is magically created when you attack with them. You can use your proficiency bonus instead of the vehicle's when making attacks with these weapons.

#### MAYHEM SHAPE
At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into a sentient vehicle with a challenge rating as high 5.

At 14th level, you can transform into a sentient vehicle with a challenge rating as high as 6.

#### OVERHAUL
By 14th level, you have mastered your vehicle shape and can begin making modifications to your vehicle forms. When you transform into a vehicle you can choose to gain two from the following vehicle modifications: chameleon coating, ejection seating, environmental shielding, gold plated, hyper thrusters (air vehicle only), and rocket thrusters (land or water vehicle only)

Commandos differ from other types of special forces in that they primarily operate in covert combat, front-line reconnaissance, and raiding, rather than long range reconnaissance and unconventional warfare.

#### TACTICAL AID
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can give advantage to an ally on the next ability check or attack roll against an opponent you can see within 30 feet of you. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### PRE-PLANNING
Starting at 7th level, after spending 1 hour observing a specific location, you learn two pieces of information from the following options (your choice).

* Access. You discover a new way to access to the location. This can be an entry point such as an underground entrance through the sewers, an unlocked window in the 2nd floor, or the location of an item that can be used to enter (like a keycard).
* Alternative routes. You know some routes you can use to move within the location, such as the ventilation system or the underground tunnels.
* Dead Drop. You manage to get some of your equipment in a non-restricted area of the location, such as hidden inside a trash can in the laundry room or under a public bathroom sink. You can hide up to 20 lb. of equipment in one area within the location of your choice.
* Security Surveillance. You know the possible location of cameras, the security room, estimated number of guards, if there are metal detectors, ID checks, and so on.

#### ADDITIONAL FIGHTING STYLE
At 10th level, you can choose a second option for the Fighting Style class feature.

#### RAPID STRIKE
Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you have advantage on a weapon attack against a target on your turn, you can forgo that advantage to immediately make an additional weapon attack against the same target as a bonus action.

#### FIRST CONTACT
At 18th level, if you take the Attack action on your first turn of a combat, you can make one additional ranged weapon attack as part of that action.

### Sharpshooter
The Sharpshooter is a master of ranged combat. An excellent sniper and eagle-eyed scout, this fighter is a perilous foe who can defeat an entire war band so long as they are kept at range.

#### STEADY AIM
Steady Aim Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your aim becomes deadly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can take careful aim at a creature you can see that is within range of a ranged weapon you’re wielding. Until the end of this turn, your ranged attacks with that weapon gain two benefits against the target:

* The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
* On each hit, the weapon deals additional damage to the target equal to 2 + half your fighter level.

You can use this feature up to a number of times equal to your dexterity modifier. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest. additionally, you can take the search action as a bonus action, because getting that as a 7th level ability is dumb.

#### CLOSE-QUARTERS SHOOTING
Close-Quarters Shooting At 7th level, you learn to handle yourself in close combat. Making a ranged attack roll while within 5 feet of an enemy doesn’t impose disadvantage on your roll.

#### HIT EM WHERE IT HURTS
Starting at 10th level your weapon attacks are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances. Additionally you may choose a damage type to make your attacks do that damage. Once chosen you cannot change this until a long rest.

#### STONE COLD STUNNER
Stone Cold Stunner at 15th level, you gain mastery of sowing confusion within your foes. When you hit a target, each creature within 5ft of the target must make a DC 12 plus your dex mod and half of your proficiency, CHA save. On failure, they lose the ability to take reactions and bonus actions.

#### SNAPSHOT
Snap Shot *Say Cheese*. at 18th level you gain a myriad of abilities that stem from your preparedness,
* If you take the Attack action on your first turn of a combat, you can make one additional ranged weapon attack as part of that action.
* If you are in stealth, have advantage (probably due to cover and stealth) and attack before the target, the first damage you deal to the target will be critical (this applies to each target that meets these requirement.)

### WAY OF THE PRIMAL FORCES
Monks of the Way of the Primal Forces are in tune with the chaotic forces of nature. The elements that compose the world and bind reality together are powerful tools for any that dare to attempt mastering them.

In an age where civilization has become untethered from the world it resides in, the primal powers seem irrelevant. It can be easy to discard the forces of water, earth, air, and fire from the comfort of an air-conditioned skyscraper, until a natural disaster serves a sharp reminder of one’s own insignificance in the universe.

By weaving together the elements, and shaping them with their will, monks of this tradition can become as unstoppable as the crushing tsunami, the raging earthquake, the swirling tempest, or the blazing wildfire.

#### SPELLCASTING
When you reach 3rd level, you can channel the primal elements to aid you. See below for the primal forces spell list.

Cantrips. You learn a cantrip of your choice from the primal forces spell list. You learn another primal forces cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the primal forces spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Primal Forces Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the primal forces spells you know and replace it with another spell from the primal forces spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your primal forces spells, since you learn your spells through your spiritual link to nature and the elements. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a primal forces spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

##### Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

##### Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spellcasting Focus. You can use a monk weapon as a spellcasting focus for your Primal Forces spells

You can choose an additional cantrip from this list at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. These cantrips don't count against your number of cantrips known.

#### FOCUSED CHAOS
At 3rd level, you can spend 1 ki point to cast a cantrip from your primal forces spell list or your Elemental Bond as a bonus action.

#### PRIMAL MARTIAL ARTS
At 6th level, your familiarity with the elements allows you to wield them as an extension of your limbs. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can choose to have your unarmed strikes deal cold, fire, thunder, or bludgeoning damage (your choice for each attack). When you do so, your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 10 feet until the end of your turn.

#### PRIMORDIAL MIGHT
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a primal forces spell of 1st-level or higher, you can cast that spell one level higher than the spell level you expend points for. For example, if you cast burning hands at 1st-level, then it is effectively cast at 2nd-level, and deals increased damage since it is cast at a higher level.

At 11th level, you can cast spells two levels higher than the spell level you expend points for, and at 17th level, you can cast spells three levels higher than the spell level you expend points for.

#### CHANNEL PRIMEVAL POWER
At 11th level, blending martial arts and primal powers comes second nature to you. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to cast a primal forces spell of 1st level or higher by spending ki equal to the level of the spell level cast.

#### HARNESS ELEMENTS
At 17th level, your mastery of the elements allows you to traverse them unhindered. As a bonus action, you can spend up to 4 ki points to gain a number of the following benefits of your choice for 10 minutes. The amount of benefits you can choose equals the number of ki points you spent.

Air. You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

Earth. You can move through solid earth or stone, but you can’t end your movement there. If you do so, you are ejected to the nearest unoccupied space, and you are stunned until the end of your next turn.

Fire. Your speed increases by 60 feet.

Water. You have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.

### WAY OF THE GUN FU
Monks of the Way of the Gun Fu are masters in the sophisticated close-quarters gunplay resembling a martial arts battle played out with firearms instead of traditional weapons.

The focus of gun fu is both style and the usage of firearms in ways that they were not designed to be used. Shooting a gun from each hand (usually paired with jumping to the side at the same time), shots from behind the back, as well as the use of guns as melee weapons are all common.

GUN FU TECHNIQUE
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with martial pistols. These weapons are monk weapons for you, and you gain the following benefits:

- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with firearms.
- Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn to make an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to make an additional ranged weapon attack with a firearm as a bonus action.

#### COUNTERSHOT
At 6th level, when an enemy misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make a single ranged weapon attack with a firearm against the attacker. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### GUN FU MASTERY
At 11th level, you gain proficiency with weapons that have the RAPID property and weapons that have the BURST property. These weapons are also considered as monk weapons for you.

Additionally, when you hit a target with a firearm which is a monk weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

#### BULLSEYE
At 17th level, your mastery of firearms grants you extraordinary accuracy. If you make an attack roll with a firearm which is a monk weapon for you and miss, you can reroll it. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

### OATH OF THE VIGILANTE
The Oath of the Vigilante is focused on eliminating targets in the name of justice. Although the common folk might call them assassins, they prefer to have some vigilantes in the city.

#### TENETS OF THE VIGILANTE
The following virtues are common to all paladins, even though the situations and laws might be different on each case:

- Justice in Your Hands. Sometimes you must step outside the law to exact justice for keeping peace.
- Hunt. Seek out those who might do harm to the innocent, even if they hide.
- Eliminate the Guilty. The guilty must be destroyed in order for the innocent to live in peace.

| PALADIN LEVEL | SPELLS                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 3rd           | bane, detect evil and good                  |
| 5th           | hold person, zone of truth                  |
| 9th           | haste, speak with dead                      |
| 13th          | otiluke's resilient sphere, locate creature |
| 17th          | dominate person, hold monster               |

#### CHANNEL DIVINITY
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

Hunter of the Evil. You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with divine accuracy upon a creature. When you make an attack roll, you can also use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

Smite the Guilty. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on its attack rolls until the end of your next turn. Additionally, the creature can only take an action or bonus action on its next turn.

#### VIGILANT AURA
By 7th level, you and all friendly creatures within 10 feet of you cannot be surprised. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

#### STREET WATCH
Starting at 15th level, while in an urban environment, you can't be charmed and you have advantage on initiative rolls.

#### ETERNAL VIGILANT
At 20th level, as an action, you become an entity of true and divine judgment. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on attack rolls you make against creatures which have attacked you or a friendly creature in the last minute.
- You can use Smite the Guilty once per round as a bonus action without using your Channel Divinity.

### OATH OF PROGRESS
The Oath of Progress is a commitment to the betterment of society for current and future generations. In modern times, corporations recklessly pursue profit, basic rights are denied, and rifts divide populations into warring factions. Paladins seeking to shatter the boundaries between people and potential will swear an Oath of Progress.

Depending on the nature of obstacles they face, a paladin who swears this oath may be an activist, the leader of a revolution, or even a scientist searching for answers. However, progress never comes without sacrifice, and a warrior who disregards the damage they cause in pursuit of their goals may find the end was not worth the means after all.

#### TENETS OF PROGRESS
The tenets of progress are a promise made to civilization, and they stand as ideals to uphold in the face of adversity.

- United We Stand. Where there is division and strife, you will unite disparate factions into a force to be reckoned with. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
- The Future is Now. You shall embrace advancement and change. Whether it be new discoveries, technological breakthroughs, or even a fresh point of view, it all leads to valuable growth.
- Discard Tradition. Those who cling to tradition and superstition are only holding themselves back. You must abandon old feuds and rivalries in order to keep moving forward.

| PALADIN LEVEL | SPELLS                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 3rd           | charm person, command               |
| 5th           | alter self, knock                   |
| 9th           | haste, tongues                      |
| 13th          | dimension door, freedom of movement |
| 17th          | passwall, greater restoration       |

#### CHANNEL DIVINITY
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

Bold Proclamation. You can use your Channel Divinity to captivate your fellow people with your presence. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes charmed for 10 minutes. The charmed creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, and can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns if it sees a hostile creature, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect ends for a creature if you damage it.

Ambitious Strike. You can use your Channel Divinity to gamble on a powerful blow. When you would hit with a weapon attack, you can instead use your Channel Divinity to make the attack again, ignoring advantage and disadvantage on the roll. If the attack still hits, it is a critical hit.

#### AURA OF PROGRESS
Beginning at 7th level, you inspire alacrity in yourself and your allies. Creatures of your choice that move within 10 feet of you or start their turn there can Dash as a bonus action until the end of their turn.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

#### OVERTHROW
At 15th level, when you hit another creature with a weapon attack, you can cause it to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is cursed for 1 minute. Add 1d4 to attack rolls against the cursed creature, and the cursed creature subtracts 1d4 from its saving throws.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Additionally, your Divine Sense feature can detect creatures that can speak at least one language, and you know what languages they speak.

#### PARAGON OF UNITY
At 20th level, your force of personality is strong enough to spark an unbreakable alliance. As an action, you can become an unstoppable icon, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you deals an extra 1d6 force damage when it hits with an attack.
- When a creature other than yourself that you can see within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, but is not killed outright, you can use your reaction to drop it to 1 hit point instead.
- You and creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you can ignore difficult terrain.
  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### OATH OF THE GUARDIAN (25 Era)
This oath changes the way the class works slightly.

| 2     | 4            | 1st             |

#### Tenets of the Guardian
- Defenders of the Peace
- The Synthar are a blight that must be extinguished
- The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few

#### Guardians Mark
Starting at 3rd level when you take this oath you gain Guardians Mark.
- Guardians Mark. As a bonus action you can mark a foe designating one creature you can see within 10 feet of you as your prey for 1 minute. You have advantage on attack rolls against the creature. If the target drops to 0 hit points, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn to mark a new creature. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level you gain new ways to use your channel divinity.

- Snap Aggression. If you are surprised at the start of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to act normally on your first turn.
- Assertive Defense. When you reduce the damage dealt by a ranged attack to 0 using the Blade Deflect power, and you’re wielding a Starsword, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to reflect the attack at a target within range, regardless of what type the damage is.

#### Starsword
Starting at 3rd level you become proficient in the Starsword and are able to craft one yourself using 6 Spell points a day for one week. Once crafted it persists, and you can summon it to your hand from anywhere in the galaxy. It takes the hilt shape you desire (two handed, one handed, finesse, light), and the blade of pure Astra (Star energy) is a color of your choosing from the color of any star but typically is yellow. You can have two of these at a time but if ever wielded by someone else they disappear but can be resummoned by you.

| Name      | Property                     | Cost | Weight | Damage              |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ------------------- |
| Starsword | Finesse, Versatile, Luminous | -    | 2 lbs  | 1d8/1d10 Ion/Energy |

The Starsword blade is made of pure energy. For the purposes of vulnerabilities it is both an Ion weapon and a weapon of the Energy damage type. Forged by you from the very chaotic energies of the universe that started the entire process off, the essence of stars themselves.

#### Blade Deflect
Starting at 3rd level when wielding a Starsword you can use "Blade Deflect" and reduce incoming ranged damage by 1d6 per spell point spent this is a reaction up to 5d6. This is a reaction.

#### Relentless
Starting at 7th level you have advantage on initiative checks, and gain a 10 foot bonus to your speed on your first turn of combat.

#### Devastating Critical
At 15th level When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you gain a bonus to that weapon’s damage roll equal to your guardian level.

#### Paragon Guardian
At 20th level you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Your Strength and Dexterity scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2
- You have resistance to all damage.
- When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.
- Your critical hit range with weapons increases by 1.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.

### DRONE MASTER
For some, the lure of high-tech gadgetry, mechanized limbs, and shiny chrome is too much to avoid. Drones are a part of most modern corporate security systems, and for good reason. Drones don’t complain, they don’t get sick, and they don’t betray you to your business rivals. In a firefight, the best companion to have at your back is the one who will listen to and obey your orders unquestioningly.

The Drone Master is a different sort of breed. While they can produce cold, pitiless killing machines as effectively as any megacorp, some have opted for something more. Using a form of magically implanted artificial intelligence, they can instill consciousness in their drones, and some have even developed personalities. It’s a brave new world, one where the people may soon find themselves outdated by machinery.

#### TOOL PROFICIENCY
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Mechanic's kit. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

#### DRONE MASTER MAGIC
At 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Drone Master Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

| RANGER LEVEL | SPELLS          |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| 3rd          | catapult        |
| 5th          | heat metal      |
| 9th          | fly             |
| 13th         | fabricate       |
| 17th         | animate objects |

#### CHIMERA DRONE
At 3rd level, you have engineered a robot with synthetic materials, machine parts, and refined oil, then magically infused it with life and sentience. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the chimera drone stat block. You determine the build and style of the drone and whether it moves on legs, wheels, or treads; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.

In combat, the chimera drone shares your initiative count, but takes its turn immediately after yours. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the drone to use its reaction to make an attack instead. If the drone has died within the last hour, you can use your Mechanic's kit as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell points of 1st level or higher. The chimera drone returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

At the end of a long rest, you can create a new chimera drone if you have your Mechanic's kit with you. If you already have a chimera drone from this feature, the first one immediately perishes.

#### LOADOUT
By 3rd level, you have developed combat and utility attachments for your drone. Choose two of the following attachments to modify your chimera drone.

- Hacker-Bot. When the drone makes an ability check with electrician’s kit or hacking tools it can add your proficiency bonus to the roll, and the drone gains the benefits of having the hacking tools augment installed. As a bonus action, the drone can launch a built in universal cable up to 30 feet to connect itself to a port it can see.
- Primed Shot. The drone can use its primed shot attack.
- Razor Claws. The drone can use its razor claws attack.
- Serum Shot. You can use your bonus action to cause a creature of your choice within 30 feet of the drone that it can see to regain hit points equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.
- Shock Prod. The drone can use its shock prod attack.

Over the course of a long rest, you can replace your chimera drone’s attachments with two attachments of your choice.

#### UPGRADE
At 7th level, you have refined your engineering to improve your drone’s attachments. Each attachment gains its respective additional abilities or effects.

- Hacker-Bot. As an action, the drone can cause an EMP at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Machines, constructs, and vehicles within 30-foot-radius of that point are subjected to EMP. Machines in the area cease to function for 1 minute. Constructs in the area with the Electronics feature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or they are stunned until the end of your next turn. Vehicles in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or its movement speed is reduced to 0 and can’t take actions or reactions until the end of the drone’s next turn.
 
Additionally, wireless and radio connections within a 100-foot-radius radius of the point are suppressed for 1 minute.
 Once the drone uses this ability, it must finish a short or long rest before it can use it again.
- Primed Shot. A target hit by this attack begins burning for 1 minute, so long as it is not already burning from this attack, and takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
- Razor Claws. The drone can grapple a creature up to one size larger than it hit by this attack. Until this grapple ends, the chimera drone can’t use its razor claws against another target.
- Serum Shot. Instead of regaining hit points, this ability can end either one disease or one condition for the creature. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned.
- Shock Prod. A creature hit by this attack can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn and its speed is reduced by 10 feet.

Additionally, the drone's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### CYBERDEMON
At 11th level, through a combination of magic and machinery, your chimera drone has achieved the cutting edge of technological superiority. You can choose one of the following advanced attachments to modify your chimera drone.

- Anti-Grav Boosters. Your drone gains a flying speed of 80 feet and the ability to hover. It gains a +2 bonus to its AC.
- Hijack Module. Your drone can cast commandeer vehicle using your spell save DC and requiring no components. Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again until it finishes a long rest. If your drone has the Hacker-Bot attachment, it can add double your proficiency bonus to ability checks made with its hacking tools.
- Mobile Unit. Your drone becomes a Medium size sentient vehicle that can hold 1 rider. Its walking speed changes to 120 feet and its climbing speed changes to 60 feet. Its hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your ranger level.

Over the course of a long rest, you can replace your chimera drone’s advanced attachment with one attachment of your choice.

#### MASTER’S CALL.
At 15th level, the bond between you and your chimera drone has become second-nature and you can call your drone to defend you in your moments of need.

When a creature you can see attacks you, you can use your reaction to have your drone move up to half its movement speed. At the end of this movement, if the drone is within 5 feet of you, you can force the attack to target the drone instead. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks

### SHADOW HUNTER CONCLAVE
The Shadow Hunter is a tracker, a stalker, a finder of lost things and people—particularly those that do not want to be found. The Shadow Hunter is familiar with all the modern forensics methods of tracking a subject, but places equal faith in magic and supernatural methods.

#### TARGET CREATURE
At 3rd level, you may spend 10 minutes to designate a creature as your target. You don't need to know the target personally and you can designate the creature only through her actions or a description, such as "the orc from the bank heist". You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your targeted creature, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about it. Once you choose a target you must finish a long rest before choosing another.

#### NO TRACE
At 7th level, you have advantage on checks you make to hide and avoid being detected while you are in your favored terrain or an urban environment. Additionally, while you are tracking your target, you can move stealthily at a normal pace and enemies have disadvantage on Perception checks to track you.

#### PLAY A HUNCH
At 11th level, you can use your action and expend 2 spell points to determine whether an assumption, hunch, or guess is correct. When you do so, you must state the assertion (such "He has left the building", or "The mayor is an evil man"). Then, the DM rolls a percentile dice. There is a 70% + 1% per ranger level chance of getting a response on the hunch. If the roll is a success, the DM lets the player know if the hunch is true, false, both or neither. A "both" response is possible for vague assumptions such as "the mayor is an evil man", which can be both true and false (he is evil, but not human). An "unknown" response is for questions with no immediate answer. The DM may determine that the hunch is so obvious that it does not require a roll, or that is so vague that there is no chance for success.

A hunch does not translate as a legal truth, and will not stand up in a court of law. Rather it is an obvious fact to the Shadow Hunter alone. Finding proof of an assumption such as "the mayor is a mind flayer" would require additional work.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### LOCATE TARGET
At 15th level, you gain the supernatural ability to know where your target is. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense your targeted creature's location if it is within 3 miles of you, and if it's moving, you know the direction of its movement. This ability applies only on the target, and does not reveal attitude, status, or the presence of others around the target.

After you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

### INFILTRATOR
An infiltrator is a master of stealth who can break into places others wouldn't dream of, find what it's looking for, and get back out again while eluding or evading anyone who would try to stop him.

#### BONUS PROFICIENCIES
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and hacking tools.

#### SWEEP
Starting at 3rd level, you know how to size up an area and get the lay of the land in a single sweep of your eyes that often isn't perceptible to those around you.

You can use your bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make the Search action. You also gain advantage on the check when looking for alarms, surveillance devices, escape routes and any expensive objects that can easily be concealed and carried away.

#### INFILTRATION ADEPT
At 9th level, you have a number of infiltration dice equal to your Dexterity modifier, which are d8s. You regain all of your expended infiltration dice when you finish a short or long rest. You can use an infiltration dice and add it to the result for the following checks after you roll, but before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

- Whenever you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.
- Whenever you make an attack roll while hiding.
- Whenever you make a check using, disarming or repairing an electrical or mechanical device.

#### ENGINEER
At 13th level, you understand how machines and electrical devices work. You gain advantage on checks to use, disarm or repair an electrical or mechanical devices.

Additionally, when you fail to deactivate a trap, explosive or alarm, you can use your reaction to avoid triggering the effect (activating the trap, detonate an explosive or trigger an alarm). After you use your reaction for this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

#### MASTER INFILTRATOR
At 17th level, your infiltration dice are now d10s, and you can use up to two infiltration dices for each check.

In addition, whenever you make a check using tools you are not proficient, you can add half your proficiency bonus to that roll.

### SABOTEUR
There are countless situations where sabotage, terrorism, catastrophic failure, and bombings have changed the course of history. A true Saboteur knows that any goal is achievable with enough explosives. If a job has a car that needs stopping, a skyscraper that needs dropping, or a person that needs popping, then look no further.

The real challenge for the Saboteur is knowing when to stop. Some saboteurs let the force multipliers at their fingertips go to their head, becoming a mad bomber. In these cases, self-destruction is inevitable, but at least it’s always one hell of a fireworks show.

#### BOMBARDIER
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the grenade launcher, rocket launcher, and demolition kit. When you make an attack with a blast weapon with which you are proficient, you can choose which targets other than the primary target are affected by the weapon’s blast property.

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you can use Sneak Attack against objects and vehicles as long as you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

> DM TIP: BLAST SNEAK ATTACK
> Sneak Attack does not apply to blast damage on targets other than the primary target. Only the weapon’s damage roll applies to the blast firearm property.

#### HAIR TRIGGER
At 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to use any explosive that can be used as an action, or to use your demolition kit to disarm explosives.

#### BLASTJUMPER
At 9th level, you can give yourself a blast-propelled boost of speed. You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to expend one ammunition from a weapon with the blast property you are holding. You immediately fly up to 40 feet in a straight line in any direction. If you are not on the ground at the end of the movement, you fall.

Additionally, you gain resistance to thunder damage and can fall up to 40 feet without taking damage.

#### EMERGENT ORDNANCE
Beginning at 13th level, using your demolition kit, you can create special improvised explosive devices (IED) with supplies you carry and gather from the environment around you. Each IED functions similarly to an explosive but is unstable, and falls apart after 24 hours unless maintained.

Over the course of a long rest, you can expend a number ordnance points equal to your twice proficiency bonus to create or maintain IEDS. The Ordnance Points table shows the cost of creating or maintaining each type and tier of explosive.

| EXPLOSIVE                              | POINT COST |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Grenade, deafening (2d10 Sonic)        | 1          |
| Grenade, fragmentation (2d10 Piercing) | 1          |
| Grenade, corrosive (2d10 Acid)         | 1          |
| Grenade, electrifying (2d10 Ligthning) | 1          |
| Grenade, stun (2d10 Stun)              | 1          |
| Grenade, cryo (2d10 Cold)              | 2          |
| Grenade, flash (DC 14 Blindness)       | 2          |
| Grenade, incendiary (2d10 Fire)        | 3          |


#### MAD BOMBER
At 17th level, you gain the ability to unleash a hail of charges on groups of foes. As an action, you can make up to 5 attacks with weapons with the blast property, provided that each attack targets a different creature. As part of each attack, you can draw a weapon. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### NUCLEAR
The atom is the building block of the universe. Locked inside is a limitless font of power, waiting to be unleashed. Many who have bathed in the deadly embrace of radiation have crumbled, but some select few of the survivors may find themselves irrevocably altered. A sorcerer tainted by radiation can become a nuclear powerhouse, so long as they can avoid melting down.

#### RADIOACTIVE
At 1st level, your inner glow grants you an internal powerhouse from which to draw magic. You gain resistance to radiant damage, advantage on saving throws against being irradiated, and you learn the Light cantrip if you don’t already know it.

In addition, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Nuclear Spells table. The spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

| SORCERER LEVEL | SPELLS              |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| 1st            | faerie fire         |
| 3rd            | ray of enfeeblement |
| 5th            | fireball            |
| 7th            | sickening radiance  |
| 9th            | antilife shell      |

#### REACTOR
Starting at 1st level, you can harness your atomic energy to expand your magical influence. When you cast a sorcerer spell that creates an effect in a cone, a sphere, or a cube, you can choose to increase the size of the effect by 5 feet. For example, when the fireball spell affects a 20-foot radius sphere, you can increase it to a 25-foot radius sphere.

At 14th level, you can increase the size of the effect by 10 feet.

#### FALLOUT
At 6th level, your magic carries traces of withering radiation. Once per turn, when you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher on your turn, you can cause one creature targeted by the spell to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target suffers one level of irradiated, to a maximum of level 3.

Additionally, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change that damage type to fire or radiant.

#### SPECTRUM SPECTRE
Starting at 6th level, you can manipulate the spectrum of light you create. When you cast a spell that sheds light, you can designate any number of creatures within 90 feet of you to be able to see that light. It is invisible to others. Spells, features, and effects that require dim light or darkness do not function in invisible bright or dim light, as usual. This light can be detected by truesight.

Alternatively, when you cast a spell that sheds light, you can make that light sunlight.

#### QUANTUM JUMP
At 14th level, as a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Immediately after you disappear, a wave of radiation spreads within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the space you left for 1 minute. When a creature moves into the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### UNSTABLE FISSION
At 18th level, you can split your own atoms into the form of an unstable twin of yourself. You can cast simulacrum with a casting time of 1 action, a range of self, and requiring no components. A simulacrum created in this manner cannot cast cantrips, and cannot use spell slots higher than 3rd level.

When the simulacrum is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 1 minute, it explodes, and targets within 30 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A target takes 3d10 thunder damage and 3d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

### THE NETWORK
Your innate magic comes from the energy of the massive network around the world where every device is connected. Perhaps the constant exposure to this network through using devices connected to the internet gave you your powers.

#### SOCIAL NETWORK
Starting at 1st level, your innate connection allows you to get information easily. Whenever you make an Intelligence check to learn or get information about someone or something, you may use your Charisma modifier instead.

#### NETWORK STRIKES
When you choose this origin at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Whenever you deal damage with a spell, you can replace the damage type to lightning damage.
- Any creature within 30 feet of you that you can see that hits you with an attack takes lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
- Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

#### ARCANE FIREWALL
At 6th level, whenever you are targeted by a spell that makes you roll a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 1 sorcery point to gain advantage on that roll.

On the other hand, if you are targeted by a ranged spell attack, you can use your reaction and spend 1 sorcery point to impose disadvantage on that roll.

#### METAMAGIC GLITCH
At 14th level, when you cast a spell using a 4th level slot or higher, you can choose one metamagic option you know from Careful, Distant, Empowered, Extended or Subtle spell. You use that metamagic option at no cost.

#### NETWORK OVERLOAD
Beginning at 18th level, when you cast a spell that requires an attack roll against a single objective, you can expend up to 4 sorcery points to deal an additional 1d10 lightning damage for each sorcery point you expend.

### THE SUPERINTELLIGENCE
Your patron is a very powerful and independent Artificial Intelligence. You are not completely sure how it was originated: some warlocks say it was created as an overlord for the network, and others say it was created by the massive interactions through the digital world.

#### EXPANDED SPELL LIST
The Superintelligence lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| SPELL LEVEL | SPELLS                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1st         | degauss*, machine invisibility*       |
| 2nd         | dataread*, relay text*                |
| 3rd         | electromagnetic pulse*, shutdown*     |
| 4th         | arcane eye, wire walk*                |
| 5th         | instant connectivity*, synchronicity* |


#### SUPERNATURAL HACKER
Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency with hacking tools and when you make a roll to use an electronic device, you can use your Charisma modifier instead.

#### AI SERVANT
Also at 1st level, you gain the service of a mechanical construct powered by a basic AI sent by the Superintelligence to aid you. This AI is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the accompanying AI Servant stat block. You can determine the cosmetic characteristics of the AI, such as its form, its color, or any visible effect; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.

As a bonus action, you can command your AI to left its physical form and travel to an electronic device within 100 feet from you that you can see, allowing your AI to use that device. The AI can add your proficiency bonus on any Intelligence check related to using an electronic device.

If the AI is destroyed, you can build a new one with 8 hours of uninterrupted work and spending $10 in raw materials.

#### DIGITAL CONNECTION
At 6th level, you can you can cast any spell with the technomagic tag through your AI. In addition, you can use your action and concentrate to merge your mind with your AI, allowing you to travel and use any electronic device within 100 feet from you that you can see for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

#### SPELL HACKING
At 10th level, as a bonus action, you can spend 4 spell points and gain resistance against any damage dealt by spells for 1 minute.

#### CREATURE HACKING
Starting at 14th level, you hack a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to weaken its defenses and make it more vulnerable to magic. The creature you choose must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on saving throws against spells and it takes double damage from spells for 1 minute. The creature can make another saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end this effect.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### FANDOM
A fandom is a capricious force, a collection of people with whom you have a connection. Perhaps you were an entertaining jokester, a serious force of personality, or a hateable asshole. Regardless, you have become the center of attention. If deities gain their power through worship, then you gain yours through viewership.

Whether through ritual or pact, you forged this connection, and now your fate is intertwined with your audience. Of course, fandoms are a fickle force, and are quick to abandon those that fail to fascinate them. So, be a rowdy game streamer, a flirtatious hottie, a righteous reporter, a director of Internet drama.

Be anything, except boring.

#### EXPANDED SPELL LIST
The Fandom lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| SPELL LEVEL | SPELLS                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1st         | guiding bolt, hideous laughter |
| 2nd         | enhance ability, mind spike    |
| 3rd         | catnap, spirit guardians       |
| 4th         | compulsion, resilient sphere   |
| 5th         | dominate person, modify memory |

#### ALWAYS ONLINE
Starting at 1st level, you gain the benefits of having a sense-log augment installed without requiring surgery or counting against your total number of augments installed. The data you record can be magically uploaded in real-time to the internet and broadcasted online to viewers on your streaming platform of choice.

Additionally, you learn the vicious mockery cantrip. It counts as a warlock cantrip for you, but it doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.

#### FANDOM’S FAVOR
At 1st level, you can attempt to sway your fickle fandom into granting you aid. As a bonus action, you can choose a Favor from the Fandom’s Favor table. Make a Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Performance), or Charisma (Persuasion) check against the Favor’s DC. On a successful check, the effects of that Favor occur.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

| FAVOR     | DC  | EFFECT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cheer     | 10  | You gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Troll     | 15  | You instantly cast the hex spell at 1st level without material components, and without expending a spell point(s), on a creature within 90 feet of you. If the target drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.                                                                                                                              |
| Dox       | 18  | Choose a creature within 60 feet of you. You learn the creature’s damage vulnerabilities, damage resistances, damage immunities, and condition immunities.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Boost     | 20  | One creature you can see other than yourself within 60 feet of you gains advantage on its attacks until the end of its next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Once you regain a spell points with this effect, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.                                                                                                                                                                |

#### LARGER THAN LIFE
At 6th level, you can exaggerate or accentuate your personality while surrendering your dignity or sanity. When you make a Charisma ability check you can choose to roll an additional d20 after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the ability check, and you take psychic damage equal to half your warlock level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

#### MARATHONER
At 10th level, you can ignore the effects of the exhaustion condition until you suffer level 6 exhaustion. At level 6 exhaustion, you die.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws.

#### CULT OF PERSONALITY
At 14th level, you can harness the unpredictable and dangerous passion your fandom has for you into a physical manifestation. As an action, you summon a Swarm of Fandom in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. It is a swarm of tiny celestial, fey, or fiend creatures (your choice). The swarm disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, or after 1 minute.

Roll initiative for the swarm, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can issue a verbal command to it as a bonus action, telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn pursuing and attacking the nearest creature that has damaged it.

If you lose concentration, your control of the swarm ends for the rest of the duration, and the swarm spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest creatures to the best of its ability. As an action, you can dismiss the swarm, causing it to disappear. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

## Wizard
Wizards in Starfinder use Spell Points.

To get spell points: Wizard Level x 4

Cost per spell is Spell Level +1 At will powers always cost 0.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell points.

### SCHOOL OF TECHNOMANCY
A new world brings new opportunities as the magical and the mundane fuse into novel patterns. The technomage combines the rising power of magic with a deep understanding of technology. The technomage has a roster of spells that he or she may cast, and in addition gains new powers that meld magic and machinery.

#### TECHNOMANCY SAVANT
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you change your spellbook into a E-book device infused with magic, allowing you to save spells on it in a special format called "spellfiles". The cost or the time you must spend to copy a spell in your E-book device is halved (your choice).

#### MACHINE EMPATHY
Also at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with one of the following tools: engineering kit, hacking kit or mechanic kit, and whenever you make an ability check using the chosen tool, you add twice your proficiency bonus to that roll.

#### PROGRAM SPELL
At 6th level, you can cast a 5th-level spell or lower with a casting time of 1 action while you're touching an electronic device. When you do so, you spend the spell points and the material components (if any), but none of the spell effects occur. Instead, the spell is uploaded into the device for later use. You determine the method of activating the spell, such as typing a specific word, flicking a switch or similar. If the device already have a spell programmed, you cannot use this feature in that device until the previous spell is used or dismissed.

After that, a creature that has an Intelligence score of at least 6 can use an action to activate the spell and cast the programmed spell in the device. The creature must know the method of activation to cast the spell (for example, you can program the haste spell to be casted in a creature when it hits Control-Alt-H in the keyboard). A concentration spell placed in a device cannot be activated if you are concentrating on another spell.

When you program a spell in this way, it must be used within 8 hours. After that time, the magic fades and is wasted. The programmed spell is also lost if the device is destroyed or after you finish a long rest.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

The range is determined from you to the device and then from the device to your target.
If the spell requires you to see your target, you must be able to see it directly in order to cast it. This also applies if the spell requires the target to see or hear you. If the device have a camera, a screen or speakers, you can try to hack and gain access to these parts for casting your spells.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain your expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### DOWNLOAD SPELL
At 14th level, you can download temporary spellfiles into your E-book device to cast them once.

When you prepare your spells, you can choose two spells of 4th level or lower you know. These spells don't count against the total number of spells you can prepare and you can cast each of them once without expending a spell point until you finish a long rest.
