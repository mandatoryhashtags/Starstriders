# Equipment
FROM THE GRAND SUPERMALLS THAT GRACE THE SHOPPING districts of major cities to the electronic vendor stations along the halls of almost every space station, shopping is a part of everyday life in almost every populated area in the galaxy. Goods and services of all types, styles, shapes and sizes can be found almost anywhere either physically or online through the Silrayne Intergalactic Matrix. Massive megacorporations push their ads across all networks. Some manufacturers compete to make the best, most cost effective gear for daily consumption, while others specialize in high-grade luxury items or vehicles. For those who brave the dangers of the deep expanse, the right piece of gear at the right time could mean the difference between life and death.

This chapter covers the different types of common and exotic gear, goods, and services your character may find useful during their exploits.

## Currency
The standard form of galactic currency is the credit (abbreviated as c). It is primarily used as a digital currency, accepted anywhere by online transfer within the core planets. For trade outside the core, however, the credit also has a physical representation: that of a flat metallic disc (a coin) made of pressed meteoric ore harvested from several planets within the galaxy.

For a conversion rate from standard 5e 1 Silver Piece (1sp) = 1 Credit

## Selling Loot
Opportunities abound to find treasure, gear, weapons, armor, and more during your expeditions. Normally, you can sell your gains when you return to a space station or populated settlement, provided that you can find buyers interested in your loot.

Arms, Armor, and Gear: As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in trade. Weapons and armor used by defeated enemies are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

Enhanced Gear and Core Stones: Selling these rare items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a more common item isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest citizens and merchants. Likewise, aside from a few common gear enhancements and stones, you won’t normally come across these items for normal purchase. The value of high-grade tech and sorium core stones is far beyond the standard level of trade and should always be treated as such.

Gems, Jewelry, and Collectibles: These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for money or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a city or a major spaceport.

Trade Goods: On the fringes, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—ore, foodstuffs, gear parts, medicine, and so on—retain their full value in trade and can be used as a form of currency.


# Armor

There are many different styles of armor that vary between different cultures, races, and manufacturers. The different types are classified below. Due to the advancements in weapons manufacturing, armor has become an absolute necessity for anyone traveling beyond the reaches of civilization. Exploring the expanse without at least a shield generator is a risky proposition indeed.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in Starstriders.

**Armor Proficiency.** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t use Magic (Astra).

**Armor Class (AC).** Armor protects its wearer from
attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines
your base Armor Class.

**Heavy Armor.** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**Stealth.** If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Shields.** A shield is made from metal, polymer, energy, or reinforced glass, and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

### Light Armor
Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

- Flight Suit. A layered set of clothing that provides basic protection from harsh climates.
- Armor Jacket. Lined with a protective mesh, this light jacket provides adequate protection while still allowing full movement without restriction.
- Light Trooper. A padded suit with a hardened flexible overlay. Standard issue for most grunts.
- Infiltration Suit. A full body suit made from high grade polymer blends. Expensive but effective.
- Emergency EV Suit. A full body suit with helmet, while wearing it you are protected from the hazards associated with low pressure environments and air toxins. Lasts 4 hours of air. While wearing this suit, you are immune to poison and disease, however, your movement rate is halved and you cannot take reactions.

| Name              | Cost | Weight | AC                | Stealth      |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------ | ----------------- | ------------ |
| Flight Suit       | 50   | 3      | 11 + Dex Modifier | Disadvantage |
| Armor Jacket      | 100  | 5      | 11 + Dex Modifier | -            |
| Light Trooper     | 450  | 10     | 12 + Dex Modifier | Disadvantage |
| Infiltration Suit | 1200 | 5      | 12 + Dex Modifier | -            |
| Emergency EV Suit | 150  | 10     | 11 + Dex Modifier | Disadvantage |


### Medium Armor
Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

Reinforced Mesh: Multiple layers of micro-woven fiber mesh. It most often comes in the form of a vest or torso covering.

Military Jacket. Popular amongst officers and mercs, this jacket’s interior is lined with protective plates and hard padding.

Medium Trooper. Much like the light variant, this is a suit of layered padding with a chest piece and guards made of tempered polymer plating.

Nanoweave Suit. This variant of the trooper armor has been fortified with a coating made of nanocarbons fused over the protective plate.

| Name            | Cost | Weight | AC  | Strength | Stealth      |
| --------------- | ---- | ------ | --- | -------- | ------------ |
| Reinforced Mesh | 100  | 4      | 12  | -        | -            |
| Military Jacket | 500  | 6      | 13  | 13       | -            |
| Medium Trooper  | 500  | 12     | 14  | -        | Disadvantage |
| Nanoweave Suit  | 7500 | 14     | 15  | -        | Disadvantage |

### Heavy Armor
Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

Guardian. Often made of inexpensive material, this bulky armor is a combination of thick padding, rigid metal plates and mesh weaving. It is popular amongst space miners and bunker sentries.

Heavy Trooper. This is a full suit of reinforced mesh underneath a layer of interlocking plates made from hardened composite. Armored gloves and boots are included as well.

Centurion. A suit of heavy trooper armor outfitted with a tempered multi-alloy chest piece with protective shoulder and leg guards. This armor is often limited to high-ranking soldiers and elite infantry.

Fusion Armor. The best in full body protection, this high-grade armor is made from fused meteoric alloys and bolstered with an additional layer of fullerene polymers.

| Name           | Cost  | Weight | AC  | Strength | Stealth      |
| -------------- | ----- | ------ | --- | -------- | ------------ |
| Guardian Armor | 300   | 55     | 14  |          | Disadvantage |
| Heavy Trooper  | 750   | 15     | 16  | Str 13   | Disadvantage |
| Centurion      | 2000  | 55     | 17  | Str 15   | Disadvantage |
| Fusion Armor   | 15000 | 60     | 118 | Str 16   | Disadvantage |

### Shields
Shields come in multiple designs – curved, cornered, composite, energy, etc. All work along the same function, being worn on the off hand and used manually against incoming attacks. The only exception is the Portable Shield Device which is active at all times.

> A portable shield device (PSD) is often worn by long distance travelers. It has a sorium core and is designed to repel high-velocity weapon fire from weapons using the same technology. It can be tailored to fit any wearable hard surfaced item like a bracer, belt, helmet, or the like. While it provides no bonus to AC, it requires no proficiency to use and counts as wearing armor versus weapons that possess the high-velocity property. It also provides a +2 bonus to Burst saves if worn without armor.
> Without a PSD or any armor, a high-velocity weapon deals an additional die of damage with an increased probability of a critical strike (see Weapon Properties).

| Name                         | Cost | Weight | AC      | Stealth |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ------- | ------- |
| Reinforced                   | 100  | 3      | +2      | -       |
| Portable Shield Device (PSD) | 50   | -      | Special | -       |

# Weapons
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a blade or a pistol, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the Astra Genesis, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.

## Weapon Proficiency
Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, batons, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, polearms, and heavy firearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

## Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

- **Adaptable**. A ranged weapon with this property can be used in close quarters combat without suffering a disadvantage on attack rolls.

- **Ammunition**. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing ammunition from a case or cocking a sidearm are all part of the attack (requiring a free hand for a one-handed weapon). If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in this section).

- **Burst Fire**. A weapon with the burst fire property can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 10-foot cube (4 map grid squares) within the weapon’s normal range. A burst is far more uncontrolled than an aimed shot. A burst fire attack can only be taken once per turn and must be within the weapon’s short range. Any creature within the 10-foot cube must make a Dexterity saving throw versus the Burst save DC or suffer the weapon’s damage. A +2 bonus can be added if a PSD is used without armor. Ability modifiers **cannot** be added to the damage roll for a burst fire attack. A weapon can be fired in burst as many times as the number in parenthesis before requiring a full round for the clip to replenish ammunition. This can also be avoided by using an action or bonus action to change out a clip. Changing a clip requires at least one free hand.

*Burst save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (if proficient) + your Dexterity modifier*

- **Energy Burst**. When a successful attack is made with a weapon with this property, a bonus action can be used to fire a burst of energy from its tip or edge. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have their movement reduced by 10 feet until the end of their next turn.

- **Explosive**. Damage from a weapon with this property counts as both fire damage and the damage type listed. Resistances or immunities apply only if the target has them for both damage types. When a target wearing no armor (or PSD) and with no natural armor takes damage from a weapon with this property, the target takes twice the number of dice in damage on the initial damage roll, but not for subsequent damage caused by the same attack. Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

- **Heavy**. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

- **High-Velocity**. This property allows a weapon to fire high velocity bullets in quick succession from a clip modified with a sorium core. There is no need to replenish ammunition unless depleted through Burst Fire. If a weapon with this property is used to attack a target that is wearing no armor (or PSD) and has no natural armor, the target takes an additional die of damage. In addition, the attack scores a critical hit on a 19-20.

- **Light**. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

- **Power Cell**. A weapon with this property uses a Power cell for its ammunition. Reload on a roll of a 1.

- **Recoil**. This numerical value indicates the minimum strength bonus required to handle a high powered recoil weapon without penalty. If this requirement is not met, you may not add your Dexterity modifier to attack or damage rolls. In addition, if the recoil value is higher than your Strength modifier by 2 or more, you are also at disadvantage to all attack rolls made with the weapon.

- **Reload**. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

- **Special**. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).

- **Stun**. This weapon can be set to stun where it deals no damage, however any target who is hit by this weapon must then make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of their next turn. This is common in Energy Weapons.

- **Thrown**. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a combat knife, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the knife has the finesse property.

- **Two-Handed**. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

- **Versatile**. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Using Recoil and Burst Fire
When a weapon has both the burst fire and recoil properties, the recoil property directly affects the burst fire property when making burst fire attacks. If a creature attacking with a firearm cannot add their Dexterity modifier due to recoil, the attacker also loses their Dexterity bonus when calculating their Burst save DC with that weapon. Similarly, if a creature’s attack with a firearm has disadvantage due to recoil, all targets of a burst fire attack with that weapon would have advantage to their burst saves.

This rule, however, is limited to the effects of recoil only, and is not universal. For example, a creature gaining advantage on a weapon attack with a firearm does not automatically give disadvantage to their target’s burst saves.

### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a crowbar, a brick, or a robot arm.

Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a crowbar is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described here.

**Grenade Launcher**. This weapon allows you to make a ranged weapon attack using your Dexterity to launch a grenade instead of making an Athletics check. You must still be proficient in grenades to add your proficiency modifier to the attack roll. The DC versus your attack roll remains the same as listed on the Grenade Range table. The minimum required range is listed in the Launcher Range column.

**Shotgun**. This weapon fires in a 30 ft. cone at one target. Roll to hit the target and use the rules for Burst Fire for anyone else caught within the radius. Firing at 10 feet will score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

**Sniper Rifle**. Using this weapon requires an attack action and a bonus action. The minimum distance for this weapon is 40 ft. If used at a closer distance, the attacker will suffer a disadvantage to the attack roll. Attacks with this weapon score a critical hit on a 19 or 20. If you use this weapon with a weapon stand or while you are prone, the recoil value is reduced to 1. Using this weapon while prone does not give you disadvantage to your attack rolls due to the condition.

### Grenades
A grenade can be thrown with a successful Strength (Athletics) check. If you are proficient with grenades, add your proficiency bonus to the Strength check. If you are proficient in Athletics and grenades, you add double your proficiency modifier to the Strength check. The Grenade Range table provides the DC required to reach the intended range. If the roll is successful, each target in a 15 foot radius must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking the full damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

If the Strength check made to throw the grenade is unsuccessful, the targets will only take half damage on a failed save and no damage on a successful one. In addition, all targets gain advantage to saves versus the grenades’ effects, if any.

There are five common types of grenades.

- **Fragmentation**. Often nicknamed “frag grenades”, these are the most common type of grenade used in military confrontations. When the grenade explodes, shards of shrapnel are propelled at high velocity within the area.

- **EMP**. Short for “electro-magnetic pulse”, these grenades release a pulse of electricity that targets electronics and powered equipment. These grenades do no damage and have no effect on living targets. All mechanical constructs and automatons must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or be considered Impaired until the end of their next turn (see appendix A). In addition, any unshielded computer panel or electronic device not worn by another creature will cease to function until the start of your next turn.

- **Gas**. These grenades release a toxic gas within its area of effect. In addition to damage, each target that fails their saving throw become poisoned (see appendix A)

- **Phosphorous**. This incendiary grenade produces intense heat through an explosive chemical reaction. Targets who fail their saving throw take an additional 1d8 fire damage at the end of each of their turns. To extinguish the flames, the target must spend an action and make a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. In addition, until the end of your next turn, any creature entering the area of effect suffers 1d6 fire damage. 

- **Stun**. This grenade deals no damage, however any target who fails their Dexterity saving throw versus this grenade must then make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of their next turn.

### SPECIAL WEAPONS
Weapons with special rules are described below.

**GRENADE LAUNCHER**

Rather than traditional power cells, the grenade launcher fires grenades. When firing a grenade at long range, or if you don't meet the grenade launchers strength requirement, creatures within the radius of the grenades explosion have advantage on the saving throw. If you lack proficiency in the grenade launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.

**ROCKET LAUNCHER**

Rather than traditional power cells, the rocket launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of rockets. When firing a rocket at long range, or if you dont meet the rocket launchers strength requirement, creatures within the radius of the rockets explosion have advantage on the saving throw.

## Gear Descriptions
- Antitoxin. A creature that drinks or is injected with this liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to automatons or constructs.

- Binoculars (Micro). These mini-binoculars extend your visual range. You can see up to a distance of 10 times the range of your normal vision. You cannot see any objects within 15 feet and are at disadvantage to all Wisdom (Perception) checks made to notice anything within 15 feet of you.

- Binoculars (Rangefinding). These are slightly larger and function the same as micro binoculars. These, however, also provide a readout of exact distance between you and a chosen point of focus. You also receive advantage to any Intelligence (Investigation) rolls made when searching for any details regarding your point or object of focus.

- Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a box of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.

- Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

- Climber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes spikes, interlocking hooks, boot tips, mag-gloves, and a climbing harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.

- Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.

- Datapad. This is a portable digital reading device which allows basic written information, data, images, and maps to be read and transferred from a linked master computer terminal which must be within a range of 200 feet.

- Diving Gear. This set of gear includes a wetsuit, oxygen supply, and attachments for underwater maneuvering. While using this gear, you ignore any underwater movement penalties and have advantage on any Strength (Athletics) rolls required for swimming checks made underwater. You gain no benefit from this item if you are wearing any armor other than a PSD.

- Explosive Charge. This small block of explosive material can be set off using a timed explosive (set for anywhere between 1 round to 1 hour) or a with a programmed detonator. Activating the charge requires an action and a successful DC 12 Wisdom check using demolition tools. If using a detonator, the charge can be triggered by using a bonus action. Once triggered, each target in a 15-foot radius of the charge must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Treat this damage as if it were a weapon with the explosive property. The charge can be moved but disarming it requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom check with demolition tools.

- EV suit. This bulky outfit is often used whenever walking into zones deemed to be biohazards. The suit has a built in air filtration unit and is chemically sealed. While wearing this suit, you are immune to poison and disease, however, your movement rate is halved and you cannot take reactions. Lasts 4 hours. (This is also listed in Light Armor)

- Fire Extinguisher. You may spend an action to extinguish any normal fire or remove any ongoing fire damage effect from any target in a 15 foot cone. This item has 10 uses.

- Flare. A flare burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

- Flashlight. A flashlight can be either held or mounted on a wrist strap, head mount, or chestpiece. It casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet.

- First Aid Kit. This kit is contains bandages, ointments, and pain medication. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

- Glow Sticks. Each of these sticks glows for 30 minutes, providing dim light in a 20-foot radius.

- Grapple Gun. This item has 50 feet of a strong, thin climbing cable coiled within its base. It can be fired and tethered to a surface with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check and hook onto a solid ledge or against most non- metallic surfaces. When using this device, you ignore any Strength rolls required for climbing checks and have a climbing rate of 30. It can hold up to 2 people without snapping. The cable has 3 hit points and an AC of 9 while extended. If used for anything but climbing, however, skill checks may still be required up to the GM’s discretion.

- Healing Ampoule. A creature that drinks or is injected with this liquid regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering this medical vial takes an action.

- Holo-projector. Linking this item to a SIM Unit or Recording Unit allows you to create three-dimensional recordings within a 10-foot square which include both video and audio. The recordings can last up to 3 minutes and are saved onto recording chips which can be played again on any holo-projector.

- Mag-lock. This magnetic clamp lock can be placed on any medium to large container, normal door, or latch. It has a digital coded lock and can only be opened with a successful DC 16 Dexterity check with Infiltration tools or a DC 15 Intelligence check with a Hacker’s kit.

- Magnetic Boots. Often used by spacers and starship technical crew, these boots allow you to secure yourself onto any metallic surface. In Zero-G, you can move at a rate of 10 feet and do not suffer from disadvantages to ability checks associated with being in Zero-G. In normal gravity, you cannot move and cannot be pushed, pulled, or knocked prone.

- Mag-Seal Case. This is a normal briefcase (see Container Capacity) equipped with a small mag-lock.

- Medkit. This small pack of emergency stims and anti- viral solutions has enough for three uses. Each use gives you advantage on a single Wisdom (Medicine) roll made to stabilize a dying creature.

# FIREARM ACCESSORIES
No firearm would be complete without proper accessorization. What better way to make an assault rifle your own than to add a razor sharp bayonet, an under-barrel flamethrower, a guncam to record your kills, and gold plating to top it off. Now you’re killing with class!

You can use a firearm with a number of accessories installed up to your proficiency bonus. If you attack with a firearm that has a number of accessories that exceeds your proficiency bonus, the attack is made with disadvantage.

Firearm accessories can be purchased and installed from most gun stores and weapon merchants. You may be able to construct and install your own accessories with tinker’s tools. Firearm addons must be purchased for a specific type of firearm. For example, you cannot purchase a pistol silencer and then attach it to an assault rifle.

> MULTIPLE MODIFICATIONS
> You cannot apply a modification or accessory to a firearm, weapon, armor, or vehicle if it already has it installed.

## AUTO-LOADER
This advanced reload system is partially attached to your body, clothing, or armor, and will automatically reload the weapon if it is stowed in your inventory (not being held in your hands) at the start of your turn.

## BAYONET
The weapon also functions as a dagger for melee attack purposes, including opportunity attacks. You must use two hands when you make an attack with this weapon.

## DEEP MAGAZINE.
The number of attacks that can be made with this weapon before it must be reloaded is increased by 50% (rounded down).

## EASY BREAKDOWN
This weapon can be broken into several parts or reconstructed from its parts over the course of a minute. While dismantled, this weapon can't be used to make an attack, but it can be stored in half the usual space and ability checks made to conceal the weapon are made with advantage.

## ELECTRO SHOCKER
This weapon will electrocute unregistered users. The creature holding the weapon will take 1d8 lightning damage for every attack they make with the weapon.

## FIREARM TRIPOD
A temporary standing mount for larger firearms. It can be used with any heavy, two-handed weapon that has the Recoil property. Setting up or dismantling the tripod takes 1 minute. A tripod-mounted weapon’s recoil value is reduced by 2. While wielding the weapon, your speed is 0 and you have disadvantage to Dexterity saving throws and burst saves. You can spend an action to detach the weapon from the tripod mount.


## FLASHLIGHT
When activated, this flashlight casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet.

## GOLD PLATED
Coats the exterior of the weapon with a thin layer of gold. Wielding this causes you to look swag as fuck.

## GUNCAM
When activated, this camera records whatever the weapon is pointed at.

## LASER SIGHT
This attachment fits onto any ranged weapon with the ammunition property. At the start of your turn, you can use a bonus action to gain advantage on your first attack roll against a target you can see within your weapon’s normal range. You can’t use this feature against targets benefitting from cover or in a heavily obscured area.

## LIGHTWEIGHT DESIGN
This weapon weighs half its normal weight. Replaces the weapon’s metal and wooden parts with plasteel, a tempered plastic. The weapon no longer sets off metal detectors and it is no longer affected by metal targeting effects.

If this weapon has the heavy property, you can choose to ignore it when you make an attack with this weapon.

## SELF-DESTRUCT
This weapon will explode if anyone other than the registered user attempts to operate it. The creature holding the weapon must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 piercing and 2d8 thunder damage.

## SILENCER
As an action you can attach the silencer to any firearm that does not have the scatter, blast, or massive properties. You can also remove the silencer as an action. This significantly muffles the sound of gunshots, so that the shot can only be heard from half the weapon’s normal range. While the silencer is attached, a ranged weapon attack with the weapon automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range.

## SLING
When you drop a firearm, you can instead choose to have it hang by its sling to your body. Only one firearm can hang from a sling at once.

## SUPERCAVITATION
Your weapon creates a bubble of gas just large enough to encompass a projectile when it fires underwater, greatly reducing the skin friction drag and enabling high speeds. This grants a firearm the marine property.


# Vehicles
Vehicles can help you travel quickly as well as carry large amounts of gear that would otherwise slow you down. Vehicles table shows each vehicle’s speed and base carrying capacity.

## Vehicle Types and Proficiency
There are four overall types of vehicles in Astra Genesis.

Putting points into Pilot will affect your ability to pilot all of these vehicle types. All vehicles use a similar control schema in Astra Genesis. To ride a beast requires Survival.

- Beast: Though not as common as machine craft, there are various species of beasts that may serve as mounts throughout the galaxy.
- Planetary: This covers all ground and hovercraft as well as low flying cars and bikes that are common in the larger cities.
- Space: Includes all spacecraft from fighters to shuttles to large cruisers. Details for spacecraft and starships are detailed later
- Watercraft: This covers any vehicle that travels upon the surface or underwater.
