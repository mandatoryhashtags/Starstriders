BURNING
A creature that is immune to fire damage is immune to the burning condition.

A burning target takes damage at the start of each of its turns. The amount of damage is determined by the source of the burning. A creature that is grappling a burning creature or carrying a burning object takes the same amount of damage at the start of each of its turns.
A burning target sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
The condition ends if a gallon of water is splashed on the burning target, or if an effect would extinguish flames in the burning creature’s space.
The condition also ends if a creature within 5 feet of the burning target uses its action to extinguish the flames.
If the burning target is an object or a vehicle, the target takes damage on initiative count 0.

FLIPPED
When a vehicle would be knocked prone, it is instead flipped unless it has a trait that says otherwise.

A flipped vehicle has disadvantage on attack rolls and can’t move.
The vehicle has disadvantage on Strength checks and saving throws, and automatically fails Dexterity checks and saving throws.
The condition ends if the vehicle is pushed or rolled upright.
A vehicle with a flying speed that is flipped and currently falling can use its action to make a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check at disadvantage. On a success, the condition ends.

IRRADIATED
Certain areas, objects, and creatures may be irradiated, and touching or standing near them can be harmful to a creature’s health. Irradiated is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of irradiated. Creatures that are immune to the poisoned condition are also immune to the irradiated condition.
