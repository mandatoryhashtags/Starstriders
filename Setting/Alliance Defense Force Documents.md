### Directives, Standard Operating Procedures, and Priority Mission Rules for the Alliance Defense Force

#### General Directives

1. **Preserve Peace:** Maintain stability and peace within Alliance territories and among member worlds.
2. **Defense:** Protect Alliance member worlds from external threats and aggression.
3. **Support:** Provide assistance to member worlds in times of crisis, including natural disasters, epidemics, and conflicts.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

1. **Engagement Protocol:** Use of force is authorized only as a last resort and must be proportionate to the threat. All engagements must prioritize the preservation of life.
2. **First Contact Protocol:**
   - Initial contact with unknown alien species must be approached with caution and diplomacy.
   - Establish communication, aiming to understand intentions and communicate peaceful purposes.
   - Report contact to Alliance Command immediately for further instructions.
3. **Handling Less Advanced Civilizations:**
   - Follow the Principle of Non-Interference: Do not interfere in the natural development of alien societies.
   - Observe and protect from a distance unless intervention is necessary to prevent genocide or planetary destruction.
   - Any intervention requires approval from Alliance Command.

#### Priority Mission Rules

1. **Mission Classifications:**
   - **Class 1:** Direct threats to member worlds (e.g., imminent invasion, large-scale natural disasters).
   - **Class 2:** High-risk reconnaissance (e.g., investigation of unknown threats, first contact missions).
   - **Class 3:** Support missions (e.g., disaster relief, technical assistance to underdeveloped regions on member worlds).
2. **Resource Allocation:** Prioritize allocation of resources and personnel based on mission classification, with Class 1 missions receiving immediate attention.

#### First Contact with Alien Species

1. **Preparation:**
   - Assemble a First Contact Team with expertise in xenobiology, linguistics, diplomacy, and security.
   - Conduct extensive simulations and training exercises to prepare for various contact scenarios.
2. **Engagement:**
   - Initiate contact using universal communication methods (e.g., mathematical sequences, basic visual symbols).
   - Document and analyze all interactions for future reference and study.
   - Avoid revealing technological capabilities or strategic information until intentions are clearly understood.
3. **Report:** Compile a comprehensive report detailing the encounter, including species information, communication attempts, and recommended next steps.

#### Handling Less Advanced Civilizations

1. **Observation:**
   - Conduct discreet surveillance to understand societal structure, technological level, and potential for conflict.
   - Identify potential risks to the civilization from external sources.
2. **Engagement Criteria:**
   - The Alliance may reveal itself if:
     - The civilization is on the verge of self-destruction.
     - There is an unavoidable risk of detection.
     - The civilization has achieved significant technological milestones (e.g., discovery of faster-than-light travel, global unity).
3. **Engagement Process:**
   - Initial disclosure to be made through indirect means (e.g., encrypted messages to scientists).
   - Gradual exposure to the concept of a galactic community to ease the transition.

### Handling Distress Calls

#### Overview

The response to distress calls is a fundamental duty of the Alliance Defense Force, reflecting the Alliance's commitment to the preservation of life and the principle of mutual aid. This section outlines the procedures for efficiently and effectively responding to distress signals from both member worlds and non-member entities.

#### Standard Operating Procedures for Distress Calls

1. **Verification and Assessment:**
   - Upon receipt of a distress call, immediately verify its authenticity and assess the level of threat or urgency.
   - Determine the origin of the distress call, whether it is from a member world, a non-member world, or an unknown source.

2. **Response Protocol:**
   - Dispatch the nearest available vessel or rapid response team to the distress signal's origin, prioritizing Class 1 mission protocols.
   - Establish communication with the distressed party to gather preliminary information, including nature of distress, number of individuals involved, and any immediate threats.
   - Update Alliance Command with all pertinent information and await further instructions if necessary.

3. **Engagement and Assistance:**
   - On arrival, conduct a swift but thorough assessment of the situation, identifying immediate needs and potential risks.
   - Provide necessary medical aid, technical support, or defensive measures to resolve the distress situation.
   - In cases involving non-member worlds or unknown entities, exercise caution to avoid undue influence or breach of the non-interference principle.

4. **Documentation and Debrief:**
   - Record all actions taken in response to the distress call, including any contact with non-member entities and the outcomes of the intervention.
   - Submit a detailed report to Alliance Command for review and debrief with the responding team to evaluate the mission's effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.

#### Special Considerations

1. **Non-Member Worlds:**
   - When responding to distress calls from non-member worlds, particularly less advanced civilizations, discretion is paramount. Efforts should be made to minimize cultural contamination and technological revelation.
   - In scenarios where direct intervention is required, aim to operate covertly, ensuring the well-being of the distressed party without revealing the Alliance's involvement.

2. **Unknown Entities:**
   - Distress calls originating from unknown entities require a cautious approach. Prioritize the safety of Alliance personnel and avoid hostile engagements unless absolutely necessary.
   - Attempt to establish peaceful communication and understand the entity's intentions. Report any encounters with potentially hostile or highly advanced entities to Alliance Command for further analysis and action.
