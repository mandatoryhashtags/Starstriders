Not much is known about The Breach.

It happened 150 years ago, it was catastrophic. It pulled entire worlds from other planes of existence into our own and into our galaxy as well as ships. Earth does know they were doing an experiment on a theorized form of travel where the ship neters another space time but that is really all that is known.

Over the last 150 years the Elves have been stalwart allies to the humans who had barely uncovered FTL flight at the time and helped guide them. Humans are going to human, so there is no Utopia it is instead a Megacorp riddled mess.

Each colony in the galaxy is either ruled by a government or a Megacorp. There are threats everywhere and Starstriders as sought to do the work no one can accpept. There is no "push for peacful exploration" like we thought of in television shows; instead it is the push to survive in a harsh galaxy where everyone care about what they can get
and the only law in the Rim (unowned space) is what you can enforce yourself.

Welcome to the 23rd century.
