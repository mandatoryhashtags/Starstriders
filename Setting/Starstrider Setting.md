> In the beginning ...
> Those words are how the book of Genesis began and I cannot help but ponder them these days. Today is the first day the Armstrong colony exists, with the failure on Mars people are watching us closely. My grandfather died in 2012, 39 years ago and this colony is named in his namesake. I looked out this morning at the slightly blue tinged dome surrounding the operations center and I was struck by how small it all looked against the gray background of the moon surface. In that moment I felt more alone than I ever had, I was supposed to feel pride, honor, and joy at our accomplishment instead I just feel empty like this is it. How do I tell the people up here with me that their great leader now has no idea how to lead a colony. I am not a colonist, I am a naval officer.

## The Breach
Not much is known about The Breach.

It happened 66 years ago, it was catastrophic. It pulled entire worlds from other planes of existence into our own and into our galaxy as well as ships. Earth does know they were doing an experiment on a theorized form of travel where the ship neters another space time but that is really all that is known.

Each colony in the galaxy is either ruled by a government or a Megacorp. There are threats everywhere and Starstriders as sought to do the work no one can accpept. There is no "push for peacful exploration" like we thought of in television shows; instead it is the push to survive in a harsh galaxy where everyone care about what they can get
and the only law in the Rim (unowned space) is what you can enforce yourself.

## The Visitors
While the Breach was open for five years. Many worlds like Corellon and Avandra were pulled from other planes of existence to their similar locations in our Galaxy, with the worlds that were here going to their planes. It is expected to have been a Multiversal Catastrophic event of unknown size.

From this event Orcs, Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Goblins, and numerous other races were found to have arrived. (Including the Sovreki world of Arkenhold which is under Syndicate control).

## Corpos

> Your briefing on Corpos. They are a real piece of work but essential to the flow of medicine and goods in Alliance Space.

### Background and Structure

The Corpos are conglomerates of various mega-corporations, each a behemoth in its sector, ranging from interstellar travel and logistics to advanced biotech, mining, and terraforming. These corporations have evolved far beyond their initial commercial endeavors to assume roles traditionally held by governmental bodies, controlling entire colonies and systems with a blend of economic prowess and administrative governance.

Their structure is a complex web of subsidiaries, partnerships, and alliances, overseen by a central council of CEOs and corporate magnates. This council coordinates the overarching strategies of the Corpos, ensuring that their collective interests are aligned and that their grip on their domains remains unchallenged.

### Governance and Economy

The Corpos govern their territories through a model that blurs the lines between corporate management and state governance. Each colony or system under their control operates much like a corporate subsidiary, with appointed executives overseeing day-to-day operations, resource allocation, and law enforcement, all tailored to maximize efficiency and profitability.

Their economies are powerhouse engines of innovation and exploitation, driven by relentless pursuit of growth and shareholder value. This has led to advancements in technology, space exploration, and artificial intelligence, albeit often at the cost of societal disparities and environmental degradation.

### Relationship with the Planetary Alliance

As a member of the Planetary Alliance, the Corpos occupy a contentious but indispensable position. Their vast resources, technological capabilities, and control over critical space routes make them a powerful ally in the Alliance's efforts to maintain peace and prosperity across the galaxy. However, their unabashed profit motive and the ethical compromises that often accompany their corporate policies put them at odds with the Alliance's more altruistic goals.

The Corpos advocate for deregulation, free trade, and corporate sovereignty within the Alliance, leveraging their economic might to influence policy decisions. Their membership in the Alliance is a delicate balance of power, with the Corpos often pushing the boundaries of the Alliance's principles to advance their interests while still contributing to the collective security and economic stability of the galaxy.

### Culture and Society

Society within the Corpos' domains is highly stratified, with a clear divide between the corporate elite and the working classes. The former enjoy unparalleled wealth, access to advanced medical treatments, and luxurious lifestyles, often residing in opulent orbital habitats or secluded planetary enclaves. The latter, however, face a harsher reality, with many living in densely populated mega-cities or remote mining colonies, their lives dictated by the demands of corporate employment and consumerism.

Despite these disparities, the allure of innovation, opportunity, and the promise of ascending the corporate ladder draws countless individuals to the Corpos' territories, making them vibrant centers of cultural diversity and social dynamism.

### Conclusion

The Corpos represent the double-edged sword of corporate dominion in space: a testament to human ingenuity and ambition, yet a cautionary tale of power unchecked by the moral and ethical considerations that bind civilized societies. As they navigate their role within the Planetary Alliance and the wider galaxy, the Corpos continue to be a defining force in shaping the future of interstellar civilization.

Each clan, with its distinct heritage and expertise, is represented by its Chieftain or a designated elder, ensuring that the decisions made reflect the collective will and welfare of the dwarven populace. The Council convenes in the Hall of Stone, a majestic chamber located within the capital fortress-city, where the fate of the empire is deliberated under the watchful gaze of ancestral statues.

The Empire is structured around a feudal-like system where loyalty to one's clan and the Council supersedes all else. This tightly knit societal fabric is the backbone of dwarven identity, fostering a deep sense of community, duty, and honor among its citizens.

### Military and Defense

Believing firmly in the principle of "anvil or hammer be," the Dwarven Empire boasts one of the most formidable military forces in the galaxy. Known as the Iron Legions, their armed forces are a formidable sight in their rune-etched armor and wielding weapons forged from the heart of dying stars. The Legions are not only a defensive force but also serve as explorers and peacekeepers in the less secure regions of Alliance space, embodying the dwarven ideals of protection, exploration, and the expansion of the Empire's reach.

The Empire's strategic military installations, from asteroid fortresses to deep-space armories, are marvels of dwarven engineering, ensuring that the Empire's borders are well-guarded against any threat, be it from pirates, hostile empires, or the unknown dangers lurking in the uncharted territories of the cosmos.

### Industrial Prowess

The Dwarven Empire's economic and industrial might is unrivaled, rooted in centuries-old traditions of craftsmanship and bolstered by advanced technological innovation. Their planets and colonies are industrial powerhouses, rich in mines and forges, where metals and minerals are extracted and transformed into goods that are coveted across the galaxy.

This industrialist ethos is not without its challenges, as the dwarven thirst for resources sometimes leads to tensions with environmental preservation efforts within the Planetary Alliance. Nevertheless, the dwarves are adept negotiators, always seeking to balance their industrial ambitions with the greater good of the Alliance and the galaxy at large.

### The Clan Council and Alliance Politics

The Clan Council's role extends beyond the governance of the Empire, as it also navigates the complex political landscape of the Planetary Alliance. The dwarves, with their characteristic pragmatism and strategic acumen, are influential players in Alliance politics, advocating for policies that strengthen military readiness, promote industrial growth, and ensure the security of trade routes.

Despite occasional friction with other members over resource management and environmental concerns, the Dwarven Empire is a steadfast ally, committed to the ideals of the Planetary Alliance and the collective defense of its members.

### Conclusion

The Dwarven Empire, with its towering fortresses and deep mines, its proud warriors and master artisans, stands as a bulwark against the chaos of the cosmos. In the ever-expanding tapestry of the Planetary Alliance, the dwarves serve as both shield and hammer, safeguarding the principles of unity, strength, and progress. Their legacy, as enduring as the very stars they call home, continues to inspire and shape the destiny of the galaxy.

## The Syndicate

In the vast expanse of the galaxy, where civilizations rise and fall under the banner of progress and unity, there exists an entity that thrives in the crevices of law and order: The Syndicate. Born from the underbelly of interstellar society, The Syndicate is a formidable coalition of criminals, outlaws, and rogue traders, masterfully orchestrating their operations from the shadows. Utilizing the intricate network established since its secretive formation in 2134, The Syndicate has grown into a pervasive force, challenging the boundaries of legality and morality across the stars.

### Formation and Expansion

The origins of The Syndicate trace back to the tumultuous era following the establishment of the Planetary Alliance, a time when the galaxy buzzed with newfound unity but also teemed with overlooked fringes ripe for exploitation. Sensing an opportunity, a conclave of the galaxy's most cunning criminal minds converged under a common banner, laying the foundation of what would soon become a galactic syndicate of organized crime. Initially operating within the shadowed lanes of trade routes and the less patrolled sectors, The Syndicate quickly expanded its influence, weaving its tendrils through the fabric of both fledgling and established civilizations.

### Structure and Operations

The Syndicate's structure is as elusive as the organization itself, with a hierarchy that prizes anonymity and flexibility. At its apex sits the Shadow Council, a mysterious cadre of leaders whose identities remain obscured even to most within the organization. Beneath them, the organization branches into various cells and factions, each specializing in different aspects of criminal enterprise, from smuggling and black market trade to extortion, espionage, and beyond.

Key to The Syndicate's success is its ability to adapt and thrive in the ever-changing galactic landscape. They employ a mix of traditional underworld tactics and cutting-edge technology, often pilfered or developed through illicit means, to stay one step ahead of law enforcement and rival factions. Their operations are meticulously planned, with a penchant for exploiting loopholes in planetary jurisdictions and alliance treaties, making them a persistent thorn in the side of the Planetary Alliance.

### Influence and Territory

The Syndicate's influence extends across a wide expanse of the galaxy, with notable strongholds in sectors where governance is weak or corruption is ripe. One of their most infamous bases of operations is Cydonia, a world shrouded in secrecy and rumored to house The Syndicate's central command. From such strongholds, they orchestrate a galaxy-wide network of crime and corruption, with every operation meticulously designed to expand their power and wealth.

Despite their criminal nature, The Syndicate has, on occasion, been a necessary evil. Their intricate knowledge of the galaxy's underbelly and their vast network of informants have made them unlikely allies to various factions seeking information or services that lie outside legal boundaries. This uneasy relationship with both the law and the lawless adds a complex layer to the galactic socio-political landscape.

### The Syndicate and the Planetary Alliance

The relationship between The Syndicate and the Planetary Alliance is one of mutual disdain tempered by cautious engagement. While the Alliance dedicates considerable resources to dismantling Syndicate operations and bringing its leaders to justice, there are moments when pragmatism dictates a temporary truce, usually in the face of a common enemy or greater threat to galactic stability.

### Conclusion

The Syndicate, with its shadowy presence and multifaceted operations, remains one of the most potent and enigmatic forces in the galaxy. Balancing on the edge of darkness, they are a testament to the enduring nature of crime in the face of civilization's march towards unity and order. As the galaxy continues to evolve, so too will The Syndicate, ever-adapting, ever-expanding, and ever-reminding the stars that light cannot exist without the dark.
