# A Home in the Stars

> What does God need with a Starship?


## Locations

### THE BRIDGE
This is where most of the action takes place. It is where the captain and senior staff control the ship, and is never left unmanned. When the ship is large, the “windscreen” is replaced with a viewscreen that can display and magnify the Galaxy outside, as well as acting as a video screen for communications. It is here that the senior staff crew their stations, advise the captain on suggested courses of action, control the main ship functions, pilot and navigate the ship, and engage in the threats they face.

### CAPTAIN’S READY ROOM — 
The captain often has additional tasks that cannot be dealt with from the captain’s chair. Usually off the main bridge, the ready room acts as a private office where the captain can deal with reports, communicate securely with StarNavy, and hold private council with her crew.

### MAIN ENGINEERING — 
While the chief engineering officer can have a post on the main bridge, they are more at home in main engineering. Usually situated at the rear of the ship, it is home to the main matter/anti-matter integrator and the warp core. Most engineering problems or situations can be resolved here, or by crawling through the network of Jefferies tubes that allow engineers access to the inner workings of the ship systems.

### SICKBAY — 
The chief medical officer can also have a post on the main bridge, but more often they can be found in sickbay. A dedicated area for tending to any injuries, illnesses and diseases that the crew may acquire during their mission. Host to advanced quarantine facilities, advanced diagnostics and biobeds, and sometimes home to the Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH) capable of assisting the chief medical officer, or assuming their role if the CMO is called away.

### TRANSPORTER ROOM — 
Larger starships will have a number of transporter rooms as these are the key means of getting the crew, equipment, and supplies to and from other ships and planetary surfaces. Overseen by a transporter chief or suitably qualified crew, transporters provide quick, efficient and almost instantaneous teleportation to previously scanned locations.

### HANGAR BAY — 
Large ships often cannot enter atmospheres, crew and supplies can take a smallcraft from the hagar bay and pilot the craft to the surface, a nearby ship, or on a separate mission.

### OBSERVATION LOUNGE — 
Many larger ships dedicate an area with a particularly good view of the sector outside to a comfortable and spacious meeting room, hosting crew briefings as well as diplomatic negotiations.

### STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY — 
A dedicated laboratory responsible for recording, and holographically projecting, detailed maps of the of the stars, as well as classifying, identifying, and tracking stellar phenomena.

### RECREATION LOUNGE — 
A place for the crew to rest and recover after a long shift, the recreation lounge is often a glorified mess hall, though on some of the larger flagships this takes the form of a bar/restaurant where the crew can socialize and unwind.

### CARGO BAYS — 
With their own dedicated transporter facilities, and often large exterior doors, these areas hold cargo that the ship is transporting to worlds in need of resources, relief supplies, or medical aid. The cargo bay transporters, for security reasons, are usually set to transport non-life-forms only.

### CREW QUARTERS / VIP ACCOMMODATION — 
Each crewmember will have their own private quarters, usually becoming larger depending upon rank and position. Some larger ships in the fleet allow crewmembers to bring their families with them on the mission, and the crew quarters can be a suite with a number of rooms depending upon the needs of the crew and family. Larger quarters are also reserved for VIP accommodation for visiting diplomats, guests, and dignitaries.

### BRIG — 
During the course of the mission the crew may encounter hostile life-forms that may need to be retained for the safety of the rest of the crew. On rare occasions, the brig can become a temporary holding cell for insubordinate or disruptive crewmembers, or prisoners being transported to more secure facilities.

### LABORATORIES — 
The explorative nature of Starfleet’s mission means most ships are home to a number of laboratories allowing scientific research and investigation. Whether this is careful examination of artefacts or discoveries from a mission, or a crewmember’s own research project, the ship has facilities that can accommodate their needs.

## Propulsion

### Impulse Drive
An impulse drive is the primary set of equipment used to propel a starship, shuttlecraft, or probe at sublight speeds.Imperium, and later the Free Republic as a whole, standardized impulse drives to use highly efficient fusion reactors that would generate energy for ship systems and plasma exhaust that could be channeled through magnetic and subspace baffles to provide thrust that resulted in propulsion. These fusion reactors utilize deuterium reactions that produce helium and hydrogen atoms, free neutrons, and an amazing amount of energy. In the setting, it means that a helmsman can both accelerate and decelerate with an impulse drive without ever having to change the orientation of their starship.

You can use these systems to not only propel your vessel at sublight speeds, but also use them in ways that require thrust like a rocket or power like a nuclear power plant. Impulse drives are used to travel within star systems, and even at quarter impulse speed, a starship could travel from low Earth orbit to the Moon in 21 seconds. At full impulse, a starship would only require around a half hour to go from the Earth to the Sun, and could travel the entire diameter of Neptune’s orbit in a little more than 33 hours. While slow compared to warp velocities, an impulse drive is able to adequately provide movement inside a star system for most of the Free Republic's citizens.

All impulse drives in common use have limitations on velocity; this speed is typically between 0.25 and 0.33c. This restriction is meant to address both safety and relativistic effects. The faster a vessel goes in real space under impulse, the more damage any particles, dust, or larger objects impacting the vessel will cause, requiring more power to deflector systems to keep everyone on board safe. Time dilation becomes an issue as well: the faster a vessel goes, the more the outside universe seems to speed up. While at low velocities this may not be a large issue, at higher speeds the ship’s crew may find themselves unable to react fast enough to outside threats. Most civilizations the Free Republic interacts with do not like vessels continually being out of sync with other ships and headquarters, so the time dilation makes coordination difficult at best. At extremely high sublight velocities, it’s possible that characters may only feel they have been traveling for days when years or decades have passed outside.

In game play, you may find that an impulse drive may shut down from heavy use, or that steep gravity wells mean the impulse drive struggles to provide enough velocity to escape. While fusion reactors are much safer than fission reactors (due to their failure only resulting in the dissipation of high-energy plasma out external vents), working near them still has dangers that you can introduce to provide some nail-biting tension, such as the plasma vents being damaged, the impulse drive taking damage during battle when maneuvering is vital, or perhaps the relativistic limiter failing and requiring repair before time (in the outside universe) literally runs out.

### Warp Drive
Starstrider without warp drive would be limited to being “Solar System Trek.” It is one of the most quintessential technological systems that every player character will encounter. Simply put, warp drive is a propulsion technology that warps spacetime around a vessel by producing a subspace bubble. This bubble allows a vessel inside of it to stay at slower-than-light velocities, avoiding relativistic effects, and moving the bubble itself at superluminal velocities. This subspace bubble is produced by warp coils, pieces of technology found in a vessel’s warp nacelles. Most vessels keep these nacelles far from the inhabited areas of the ship for safety reasons, but this isn’t a firm design rule. Warp travel requires significant amounts of power, even at low speeds, and this is commonly provided by matter/antimatter reactions inside of a warp core. In Starnavy vessels, the matter and antimatter streams converge inside a chamber where a faceted dilithium crystal helps to focus the resultant plasma into a ship’s warp plasma system, channeling the high-energy material to the vessel’s warp coils.

This form of energy generation isn’t the only means of providing power to warp drives. The Elven Star Republic builds vessels that power their propulsion through a naked singularity. Any kind of large power source can provide power to drive a vessel in warp, even fission reactions found in modern nuclear reactors, though the lower the amount of energy provided, the lower the warp velocities. Much like other types of propulsion, warp coils are unable to sustain their maximum power rating for long durations, and vessels that have been traveling at higher than cruising speed must often slow or even stop for a period of time to let the coils cool or to perform maintenance.

While warp speeds are incredibly fast by early 21st century standards, space is a very large place, and traveling between star systems isn’t something that happens in moments. A ship cruising at warp 5 (216 times the speed of light) would take 10 days just to travel between Earth and its closest stellar neighbor, Proxima Centauri (Pioneer). Even in the 24th century, when starship cruising speeds are higher and the warp scale was reconfigured, a ship cruising at warp 6 (392 times the speed of light) would still take nearly 4 days on the same journey.

Standard warp isn’t the only way to travel at superluminal velocities. Hyperdrives are another technology which travels essentially faster than light by shunting the ship into hyperspace and traveling a vast distance in a short amount of time under the power of its Impulse engines. 

## Sensors
SENSOR TECHNOLOGY IS A BROAD CATEGORY OF technology ranging from the “Mark 1 Eyeball” to the most advanced multispectral interferometric wideband subspace/EM detectors of the 24th century. Sensors are any device that can detect the outside universe and provide information about that occurrence to the user. Eyes see the visible portion of the EM spectrum and provide data to the brain to help a person interpret their surroundings. Dolphins use a form of sonar, allowing sound waves from their chirps to travel through the water and bounce back off objects so the dolphin can better interpret their surroundings. In the Star Trek universe, there are far more things to detect than just the visual part of the EM spectrum and sound in water!

The most common sensors player characters will come across while on a starship are longrange sensors. These are a variety of detection devices that operate by sending out pulses of wide-spectrum subspace energy and detecting the reflected energy that returns. The most important aspect of these sensors is that they use subspace; they aren’t limited by the speed of light. This is why starships can detect vessels approaching from light-years away, why the bridge crew can see a star collapsing as it happens even though they are light-minutes or hours distant, and how a starship navigates around obstacles in their path while at warp. 

These sensors operate on principles similar to modern-day radar and are used to determine the location of a ship or other object along with some basic information about it, such as speed, size, and mass. Operators skilled with such systems can tease out quite a bit of information about stars and planets, but detailed information is limited. In other words, a science officer won’t be able to detect where a specific person is standing on a planet’s surface from light-years away, but may be able to tell that there are many people on that world, via electromagnetic emissions typical of a technological society.

Short-range sensors are similar to their long-range counterparts but have a larger amount of data they can gather at a higher resolution. Many of these sensors have no need to operate at faster-than-light speeds, so they do not rely on subspace to function, but often can be tied into subspace devices to get longer-range data than they otherwise would. These devices include standard electromagnetic spectrum detectors (cameras, as an example), particle detectors (such as Geiger counters), and even telescopic or microscopic equipment. Examples of short-range sensors include scanners, medical scanning equipment, diagnostic equipment in engineering, etc. A rule of thumb is that if there is a real-world equivalent to a sensor (an optical telescope, Doppler radar, magnetic anomaly detector, blood pressure monitor, etc.), then the sensor falls into the shortrange category.

As the resolution at which a sensor is supposed to scan gets higher (i.e., moving from scanning something the size of a Human to a size of a cell), the closer the sensor needs to be to function well. This is why patients lay down in sickbay to be scanned for their injury or illness instead of being diagnosed from across the ship. It’s also why stars can be scanned from quite long distances but planets require closer proximity. For example, a star system may be detected from dozens of light-years away, a planet in that system or a starship not attempting to hide may be detected from several light-years away, and intelligent life on a planet may be detected as far away as a few light-years. Determining that the life-signs are humanoid will require the starship to be in the same star system as the world, detecting that the humanoid life-forms are Elven may mean being an AU (150 million kilometers) away, and getting an accurate count on how many Elves are living on the planet would require the starship to be in orbit. Discovering that the Elves on the planet are sick will require being within tens of meters of the Elves, and identifying the viral infection they are stricken with will require close contact.

No approach yields more accurate information than being up close with whatever it is you are scanning and being able to manipulate it yourself. Exploration is far more than looking at something from a distance; it is about seeing, smelling, and experiencing it. And that means getting off your ship and transporting down to the planet or over to that alien spacecraft to check things out first-hand.

## Smallcraft
WHILE STARSHIPS MAY BE THE CAPITAL SHIPS OR ocean liners of the universe, smallcraft (also called) shuttlecraft are more akin to personal transportation. Shuttlecraft are small, space-capable vessels that most citizens of the Free Republic have easy access to. They are common sights both in planetary atmospheres and when traveling between worlds. Some shuttles have limited warp capabilities, and while you may not want to take long journeys between star systems with them, they can reduce the time it takes to get to faraway planetary bodies within a star system to hours. You can use shuttlecraft in any way you can imagine using an automobile, aircraft, helicopter, or shortrange spacecraft such as the space shuttle orbiters
