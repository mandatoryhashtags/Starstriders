# Profession System
In Starstriders you take on the role of a adventurer trekking across the stars, you are not heroes per se but some people may consider you as such. Starstriders do the work that must get done in the galaxy, even if no one wants to talk about it. Bounty hunting, murder for hire, corporate espionage, smuggling, piracy, all of these and more are done by Starstriders every moment of every day throughough the known galaxy.

You are one of those Starstriders. But who were you *before* you becamse a furious Android Barbarian, or cunning Rogue?

> Game Designer: To be clear. Class only advances by Milestone. The Profession system ***COMPLETELY*** replaces the skill system in 5e. This system has some cross over. Your attribute modifier and your Proficiency modifer do play a role in your skills by giving you a greater margin for error in your rolls. 

Your profession is often separate from your Class. A class represents combat training. Your profession represents what your character did before they took on a role as a Starstrider. 

Put simply: Class comes into play in Ground Combat just following 5e rules. Profession comes into play outside combat more skill based (and also starship combat).

> Game Designer: If something says you get Advantage on a specific kind of skill check from your class add 2 to your TN if you have disadvantage subtract 2. If something says you get Expertise such as a Rogue you add a free d20 to your dice pool.
> 
> Jack of All Trades. Works exactly as it does in 5e. Normally you cannot add your proficiency modifier to skills with 0 Rating. With Jack of All Trades you can add half rounded down minimum 1
> 
> Reliable Talent. Slightly different. Any skill you are proficient in with at least 1 rating, the lowest TN you will need is 10 regardless of other factors. 



> Advantage example
>
> Rex has a Strength 16 and a +3 Modifier and a +2 proficiency modifier
> He has a Athletics of 5.
> He has advantage on Athletics checks involving running, he is chasing an Orc through the streets of Horizon's Capital. 
>
> He needs an 10 or less normally but with Advantage he needs a 12 or lower.
>
> The Orc on the other hand has a wounded leg and is at Disadvantage on his check. 
> He has a Strength of 15 with a +2 Modifier and a +2 Proficiency Modifier with a 3 Athletics.
> He normally needs 7 to keep ahead of Rex. But with Disadvantage he needs a 5 or less. 
> On paper it looks like Rex is going to be able to catch him.
> The Gamemaster says each success will close a distance for Rex and open for the Orc.

No skill can ever go above 5.

At first level you have 24 points to spend on skills. You get 6 Focuses (Explained later). As your level increases you get 1 skill point to spend per level all the way to 20 anywhere you want remember no skill can ever exceed 5. So at 20th level you would have 43 skill points (24 starting skills + 19 skills from leveling).


## Backgrounds
Write down whatever label you want for your background. Fold it into your backstory. Were you Orphaned as a child? Put that in there and pick skills that make sense for an Orphaned Child. Work with your gamemaster. The removal of "Background Features" is replaced by the addition of a FEAT.

### Background Features
* Pick 1 Feat
* Write 1-2 values
* Pick 3 Focuses

> Game Designer: What do 5th Edition backgrounds all have in common? No one cares. I have played 5th edition since its inception and DM'd over 2000 hours of it and I have almost never seen someone *use* their background feature. But feats like Lucky? Every day.

#### Values
A value is a core concept, or cornerstone of your character. In 5e these were Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws. They almost never serve a purpose so they are replaced in Starstriders with Values. Written as a guideline about your character they come into play using Adversity later. Values are neutral they can be for you and against you. You can invoke a Value to gain a Point of Adversity which must be spent immediately. If the gamemaster uses your Value against you it is called a "Compel" if the gamemaster compels you with a value you gain an Adversity point to save for later (remember Adversity expires at the end of the session) or you can spend a point of Adversity from the pool to resist the compel. Adveristy from a compel can be spent immediately or added to the party pool.

> A compel example.
> Rex Dowing is a proud Elven warrior, one of his values is "I will never back down from a challenge." 
>
> His party is hanging out in a cantina undercover trying to gather information on the location of a Biotech research facility. 
>
> The gamemaster smiles at Rex's player, holds up an Adversity token.
> (Rex's player): I don't like that smile.
> Gamemaster: There is a drinking game going on here at the cantina, the guy running it points at Rex at yells out I bet you couldn't get three drinks down!
> (Rex's player): Dammit.
> Gamemaster: Rex is compelled by his value, how do you want to handle this
>
> The party has three Adversity in their pool to use.
> Rex: "I bet my smiling face is the last thing you see before you pass out!"
> Rex's player takes the Adversity token, and promptly lays it on the table.
> Rex's Player: "I am spending an Adversity to create an advantage to resist the alcohol and I am immediately going to drink three drinks."
> Gamemaster: "Ho! The game is afoot then. Give me a constitution saving throw for the third drink as the first two don't do much; the alcohol will do d4 stun damage you are saving for half but with your Adversity you gain immediate resistance to its effects for the duration of the drinking game."
> Gamemaster: "The resistance will serve better than just getting advantage on the saves."
> Rex's Player: "Awesome! (looks at the skeptical players) Don't worry guys maybe I can cause a distraction long enough for you to sneak into the office and look for information!"
> Game continues.

As you can see from the example Adversity and Values are a unique role play aspect that allow the game to become more interactive.

## Professional Development
Profesional development represents what career your character had (and in some cases may still do). If there is not one that suits your character vision work with your gamemaster to make one. While there is not one for Rimworld Lawkeeper or a Computer Slicer, your gamemaster could definitely assist you in coming up with what that looks like.

- Write down 2 more values your character gained from their profession.
- Spend 24 Skill points on your skills as you see fit. No skill above 5. You must spend at least 1 point in each discipline. 
- Pick 3 focuses your character gained from their profession


#### Profession Name
Description text
- Skills:
- Focuses (Pick 3):
- Some Value Suggestions:


## Final Checks
Your Attributes should total 87 (85 for Android) with nothing over a 16 nothing lower than 6.

Skills you should have 24 skill points total at 1st level. No skill higher than 5. And each discipline should be at least 1.

You should have 6 focuses.

If your gamemaster is using Aspects/Values you should have 4 of those

### Simplified Starstriders
If your gamemaster is running "Simplified" Starstriders you will have 16 skill points with none higher than 5 and only 1 at 5, and none lower than 1 across the 6 disciplines

| 19    | 42           |
| 20    | 43           |

## Disciplines
The six disciplines represent very broad categories of education, training, and natural talent. Your rating in a Discipline is equal to the highest rating in a skill belonging to that Discipline. This comes up when you are trying something that does not fit the standard skills where you can use your natural aptitude for skills in that Discipline to help you carry you a bit. This is also helpful as the disciplines are not tied to a specific attribute and when used the GM will call for an Intellect + Security check or a Strength + Medicine check; it just depends on which combination makes the most sense. Raw skill rarely comes into play in Space Combat because you are using a Smallcraft or a Starship (Pilot is one of those rare things) so during Space Combat you always use Disciplines. In some cases (like Pilot, Engineering, and Science) the Skill and the Discipline share the same name. 

> Using Disciplines this way in space combat allows the best chance for players to have fun in space combat without having to "gimp" themselves in some way in the rest of the game. Maybe a character is a merchant and it doesn't make sense for them to have points in Science, but when space combat comes up they are the one running the Sensors it would be great if they could apply that 5 Appraise (a Science discipline) to their checks instead of their 0 Science.

## Making Skill Checks

| Skill Type       | Target Number Calculation                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Proficient Skill | TN = (Attrbiute Modifier ) + (Proficiency Bonus) + Skill Rank (Max 5) |
| Untrained Skill  | TN = (Attribute Modifier) Minimum 1                                   |
| Discipline       | TN = (Provided Attrubte Modifier) + (Provided Discipline)             |

Starstriders centers skills around the concept of successes. 


## TASKS
Almost any activity where there is doubt in the outcome, where failure or Complications are interesting, or where the degree of success is important can be regarded as one or more Tasks. A single Task represents a single activity that is an attempt to overcome some resistance or conflict. Tasks should, realistically speaking, be actions attempted in one sitting in a short amount of time; for example, scanning for life signs, fixing a device, or giving a diplomatic speech.

### TASK DIFFICULTY
Difficulties represent how challenging a Task is, based on environment, opposition, or established obstacles. Traits are a key part of that and while most basic Difficulties might begin at 1. 



## What is Success


### Levels of Difficulty

### Why roll on a 0 Success needed roll?


> Game Designer: Why 2d20 and not 1d20? Because I want to. This entire system exists because I want it to.

| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0      | Untrained, unskilled, lacking in innate aptitude                                                 |
| 1      | Basic training, rudimentary skill, or a raw but undeveloped aptitude.                            |
| 2      | Professional competence, from a combination of training and talent.                              |
| 3      | Experienced and well-trained, or an aptitude developed through study and training.               |
| 4      | Excellence within the field, achievable through dedication and experience.                       |
| 5      | Exceptional, often a combination of intense training, hard-won experience, and natural aptitude. |

### Focuses
The Skills characters are trained in are broad; Focuses allow a character to demonstrate talent for a narrower set of disciplines, representing specialization and the kind of expertise that comes from deeper study and practical experiences. Focuses are not tied to any specific Discipline, and can thus be applied to any Task a character attempts, so long as the Focus would logically benefit the Task being attempted.

Main Characters will have six Focuses, and they are encouraged to create their own Focuses. Each Focus should be narrower than the a skill that every character can be trained in, but they shouldn’t be so narrow as to never come up in play. There is no specific link between Skills and Focuses; a Focus can be applied to any Skill — for example, Astrophysics could easily be used for Physical Science Tasks, but it also has potential uses when trying to plot a course using System Operation. 

When making a skill check and applying a Focus you will be granted an extra success for every dice that equals or is less than the rating of the Skill Being used.

> **Example Focus in Play**
>
> Sam wants to plot a course from Earth to Nexus, he has System Operation 3, and an Intelligence modifier of +2, and a proficiency modifier of +2. Sam has a TN of 7 on a d20 or lower, since he is using a Focus anything he rolles 3 or lower will give him 2 successes (his System Operation skill is 3).
> The gamemaster tells Sam that he only needs 1 success for this it is a task but not so trivial it does not need to be rolled
> Sam rolls 2d20 and gets a 2 and a 12. He has 2 successes. Since that is more than what he needs the gamemaster gives Sams party an Adversity Token (see below) for the extra success.

### Skill Descriptions
-- TODO

# Adversity
Do you prefer games that do not use a currency system? Well then this is not the game for you.

## What is Adversity
Whenever a character attempts a Task and scores a greater number of successes than the Difficulty, then these excess successes become Adversity, a valuable resource that allows characters to complete the Task more quickly or more thoroughly than normal, or otherwise gain additional benefits. Each success above and beyond the Difficulty of a Task becomes one point of Adversity, which the character may use immediately, may save for later, or some mixture of the two.

Characters do not begin a mission with any Adversity: it only comes from action.

Additionally when you roll a critical failure (a d20 on a skill check or a 1 in combat) you are granted an Adversity.


## How to Spend Adversity
The normal use for Adversity is to improve the outcome of a successful Task, such as gaining more information from research, or making more progress with an ongoing problem.

Immediately after determining if a Task is successful, the GM will describe the basic outcome of that Task. Adversity may then be spent to improve this outcome, or provide other benefits. Adversity used in this way doesn’t need to be declared in advance, and each point can be spent one at a time as required. Thus, Adversity can’t be wasted by being used on something that wasn’t necessary.

Most uses for Adversity can only be used once on any given Task, or once in any given Round in combat. Some Adversity spends are noted as being repeatable, which means that they can be used as frequently as the character wishes and as the Adversity available to spend on them.

Once the character’s Task has been resolved, any unspent Adversity is added to the group pool; Adversity that cannot be added to the group pool is lost if it isn’t spent.

* CREATE ADVANTAGE: Adversity can allow a character to produce a positive or advantageous circumstance. Spending two Adversity establishes an advantage in a given situation.

* CREATE OPPORTUNITY: (Immediate, Repeatable). One of the most straightforward uses of Adversity is to add bonus d20s to a Task. The decision to purchase bonus dice must be made before the dice pool is rolled. The cost of this increases for each die purchased (regardless of how those bonus d20s were bought); the first die bought costs 1 Adversity, the second one costs 2 Adversity, and the third die costs 3.

* CREATE PROBLEM: (Immediate, Repeatable). A character can choose to make things more difficult for an opponent, increasing the Difficulty of a single Task by one for every two Adversity spent. The decision to increase a Task’s Difficulty must be made before any dice are rolled on that Task.

* OBTAIN INFORMATION: (Repeatable). Adversity from a successful Task allows a character to learn more about a situation. Each point of Adversity spent can be used to ask the Gamemaster a single question about the current situation, or an item, object, structure, creature, or character present in or relevant to the scene at hand. The Gamemaster must answer this question truthfully, but the Gamemaster does not have to give complete information — a partial or brief answer that leaves room for further questions is more common. The information provided must be relevant to the Task attempted, and it must be the kind of information that a character using that skill would be able to determine in that situation — a character could use Medicine to diagnose an illness, or Security to identify a form of ranged weapon from the damage it causes

* WE PLANNED FOR THIS (Immediate): By spending a single Adversity the player can declare a change to a scene such as if they did not bring rope they can spend an Adversity to say "Wait we planned for this, we brought rope." This working is up to the GM and must match the scene in question.

## Saving Adversity
As noted above, characters have the option of saving Adversity, rather than letting unspent Adversity go to waste. This saved Adversity goes into a group pool, which can be added to or used by any character in the group, representing the benefits of their collective successes. This pool cannot contain more than six points of Adversity.

During any successful Task, any member of the group may spend points of Adversity from the group pool in addition to those generated during that Task. As normal, Adversity only needs to be spent as needed, so a character does not have to choose how much Adversity they are spending from the group pool until they spend it, nor does it need to be spent all at once.

Adversity cannot be saved forever.
