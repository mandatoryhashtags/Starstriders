# Introduction

This is the game Astra Genesis.

It takes inspiration and uses the 5th Edition OGL D&D version. It also uses inspiration from Fate, and a number of other systems like Decipher's Star Trek RPG, 2d20 systems and some just flat made up stuff.

## Starstriders
Mercenaries mostly. People who do jobs to get paid, don't matter much what it is.

## How did we get here
Its a long story.

Built by humans, former slaves. Their appearance is distinguished by artificial skin with a unique whitish-yellow hue, complemented by striking yellow eyes, which serve as windows into the complex circuitry of intelligence housed within. Crafted with the intent to bridge the realms of organic and artificial life, these androids embody a perfect blend of human-like aesthetics and advanced technology, enabling them to navigate both human society and the challenges of the cosmos with grace and efficiency. Their existence is a testament to the ingenuity and aspiration of their creators, striving for a synthesis of form and function that transcends the boundaries of traditional life forms.

## Drakneri 
Drakneri look very much like the dragons they evolved from standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first drakneri had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.

\pagebreakNum

The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some drakneri clans. These drakneri often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.

## Dwarves
Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.

Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.

## Enox 
The enox are green-skinned humanoids.

## Gelatin
(geLatin like Angle)

Gelatin are amorphous beings with no typical shape. In the presence of other folk, they often adopt a similar shape, but there’s little chance of mistaking a gelatin for anything else. They consume food by osmosis, the way an amoeba does, and excrete waste through tiny pores. They breathe by absorbing oxygen through another set of pores, and their limbs are strong and flexible enough to grasp and manipulate weapons and tools. Although most gelatin are translucent gray, they can alter their color and translucence by absorbing dyes through their pores.

Gelatin don’t have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves. These nerves enable a gelatin to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations. Gelatin can stiffen the outer layers of their bodies to maintain a humanlike shape, so they can wear clothing and accessories. They speak by forcing air out of tubular cavities that constrict to produce sound.

When gelatin sleep, they lose their rigidity and spread out and are thus sometimes mistaken for a rock or some other feature of the environment.

Their dismal swamp homes might lie hundreds of light years from the nearest human colony, but the gap between their way of thinking and that of the smooth-skins is far greater.

Despite their alien outlook, some sovreki make an effort to understand and, in their own manner, befriend people of other races. Such sovreki make faithful and skilled allies.

# Class Options

This game uses classes from the 5th Edition SRD.

In Starstrider very few people actually have classes, only the elite do. You are one of those, you are a Starstrider.

The following are Class Options for players that fit the setting. As a rule under each class is a list of Subclasses or Options that are common in the game. Anything outside this list would need approval from the Game master.

Spell Points: Full casters get their level in spell points x4, half casters (ranger, paladin) get their level x2, and 1/4 casters (Arcane Trickster, Eldritch fighter, Primal Monk) get their level in spell points. Warlocks are special cases where they get level x3

Cantrips: Are at will and cost no spell points

Spell Slots: These do not exist. If something says spell slots ignore it. Every spell costs its level +1 to cast. The restriction on 1 spell per day of 7th, 8th, and 9th level still applies from spell points they are taxing

> Designer note. This means that your casters can cast a lot of spells. Your fighters than fire a lot of rockets and barbarians can throw a lot of grenades too. I have done away with vancian magic in favor of a mana based system.

Even though some people think they are dangerous individuals, there are several pirokinetics that use their abilities for extinguish hazardous fires that threaten life, property, and the environment as well as to rescue people from dangerous situations involving fires.

#### BONUS CANTRIPS
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you know the control flames and produce flame cantrips. These spells count as artificer cantrips for you, but you cannot replace them with another cantrip from the artificer spell list when you level up in this class.

#### PYROKINETIC SPELLS
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Pyrokinetic Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.


| ARTIFICER LEVEL | SPELL                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |

| 17              | flame strike, immolation       |

#### PYROKINETIC AMPLIFIER
Beginning at 3rd level, you can canalize and amplify your pyrokinetic abilities. Using Mechanic's kit, you can take an action to magically create a pair of flaming gauntlets or for imbuing a weapon with your arcane energy. You can use the pyrokinetic amplifier as a spellcasting focus, and you gain new features depending on what option you choose, which are detailed below.

- Gauntlets. You touch your forearms to create a pair of flaming gauntlets. You gain the following features:
- Armor of Embers. Whenever you take fire damage, you can use your reaction to generate a protective flaming shield that absorb part of that damage, reducing the fire damage by 1d4. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
- Burning Spells. When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, lightning, or thunder damage, you can change that damage type to fire.
- Weapon. You touch a weapon you're proficient, giving it a fiery aspect. While you're using that weapon, it gains the following features:
- Flaming Weapon. Whenever you hit with a weapon attack, the target takes an extra 1d4 fire damage. This fire damage count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity. The weapon can also ignite any flammable object that isn't being worn or carried.
 
\pagebreakNum

- Critical Combustion. Each time you make a critical hit with your pyrokinetic amplifier weapon, the attack generates a fire explosion. After dealing the damage from the critical hit, the target and every other creature within 10 feet from it other than yourself must make Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Once you create a pyrokinetic amplifier, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell point(s) of 1st level or higher. You can have only one pyrokinetic amplifier at a time.

#### PYROMANCER
At 5th level, you are an expert on controlling and sensing the fire around you, fueling your spells and abilities with it. You gain the following features:

- Whenever you cast a spell using your pyrokinetic amplifier as the spellcasting focus, you deal an additional 1d8 fire damage.
- Additionally, you can spend 1 minute to focus on detecting heat and thermal signals in a 120 feet radius for a number of minutes equal to half your Artificer level (rounded up). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and it only gives you the general direction and intensity of the sources of heat, but not the type (like if it's a creature or an object) or the exact number of sources.

#### IMPROVED AMPLIFIER
Starting at 9th level, your pirokinetic amplifier is capable of canalize even more your arcane magic, granting the following changes to each type.

Gauntlets. The fire damage reduced by the armor of embers is now 1d8, and whenever you reduce damage with this feature, you are healed by the same amount.

Weapon. The extra fire damage the weapon deals is now 1d8 and your attacks using your pirokinetic amplifier weapon score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Additionally, you can spend a spell point(s) instead to use the critical combustion feature each time you hit a target with your weapon. The damage dealt from the critical combustion feature now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity.

#### MASTER OF THE FLAMES
Starting at 15th level, you have mastered the control of fire through your pyrokinetic abilities:

You gain resistance to fire damage.
You can cast conjure elemental (fire elemental only) and investiture of flame without expending a spell point(s), without preparing the spell, and without material components, provided you use your pyrokinetic amplifier as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.

### MECH PILOT
Mastery of the modern battlefield requires a hybrid approach of technology and magic, and no combat specialist epitomizes this approach better than the Mech Pilot. Armed and armored in an enchanted mobile suit, the battle mech is a flexible weapons platform built to be reconfigurable. This allows it to fit into any tactical situation on evolving battlefields.

The Mech Pilot’s bond to their battle mech is critical to their success. The battle mech is attuned to their pilot’s magic, and strong fluctuations of that power source can cause instability, desynchronization, and mission failure. However, a Mech Pilot with mind and mech united can become an unstoppable force.

#### MECH PILOT SPELLS
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Mech Pilot Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| ARTIFICER LEVEL | SPELLS                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |

| 5th             | gust of wind, shatter                   |
| 9th             | lightning bolt, thunder step            |
| 13th            | fire shield, storm sphere               |
| 17th            | steel wind strike, teleportation circle |

#### BATTLE MECH
At 3rd level, your knowledge of arcane mechanics has allowed you to develop a sophisticated mechanical suit that you pilot into battle. Over the course of a long rest, you can use your Mechanic's kit to create a battle mech, which functions as a magical suit of medium armor. The armor weighs 200 pounds, which you can ignore while you wear it. The armor can be the target of one of your artificer infusions.

You gain the following benefits while wearing the battle mech:

- When you attack with a weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.
- You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
- You gain proficiency with all martial weapons.
- The armor is powered by your magic, and any creature other than you that dons the battle mech receives no benefits, they cannot use its properties, and the creature's movement speed becomes 0. The armor continues to be a battle mech until you creature another battle mech.

\pagebreakNum

#### TACTICAL ASSAULT ARRAY
Also at 3rd level, you can adjust your armor for a given combat situation. When you create your battle mech, choose one of the following modes: hellion, valkyrie, or titan. The mode you choose gives you special benefits while you wear the battle mech, and determines its properties as armor per the Battle Mech Armor table.

You can change your battle mech’s mode whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have mechanics kit in hand.

| MODE     | ARMOR CLASS               | STEALTH      |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| Hellion  | 12 + Dex modifier         | -            |
| Valkyrie | 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) | -            |
| Titan    | 16                        | Disadvantage |

#### JUGGERNAUT
Starting when you select this path at 3rd level, when you are targeted by an attack or a spell while you're raging, you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to your rage damage until the beginning of your next turn.

Additionally, you gain advantage in saving throws against being knocked prone or moved against your will.

#### DRAW FIRE
At 6th level, you can use your reaction to distract opponents and convince them that you are the most dangerous target in the area. Choose one creature that you can see within 15 feet of you which is attacking one friendly creature. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC equals to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or attack you instead.

#### BODY GUARD
At 10th level, while you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. A creature is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.

#### DEVASTATING RAGE
At 14th level, when you have half or less hit points while raging, you can add your Rage Damage bonus to attack rolls.

### Street Savage
Heavy metal, rusty junkyard scrap, and a bad attitude all wrapped into one package. The Street Savage is one mean motherfucker who specializes in launching as much lead as possible at any stupid sonnofabitch that looks at you cross-eyed. Preferably from a monster truck.

More cunning than one might give them credit for, the Street Savage is adept at attaching all manner of brutal instruments to their weapons. Does this gatling gun need a chainsaw? Should I mount a rocket launcher on my flamethrower? When I die, should I go to hell with friends? The answer is always, “YES!”

#### WALKING TANK
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can leverage your ferocious strength and rage into your firearms. You gain the following benefits:

* When you attack with a heavy firearm (one that has a Strength requirement), you can use your Strength modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier for the attack roll.
* Where your Barbarian features apply to melee weapon attacks, they now also apply to ranged weapon attacks with heavy firearms.

\pagebreakNum

#### SAVAGE ACCESSORIES
At 3rd level, you can modify your firearms to be more useful in brutal combat. You gain proficiency with Mechanic's kit and land or water vehicles (your choice). If you already have either of these proficiencies, you instead gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

Over the course of a long rest, you can add one of the following savage accessories to a two-handed, heavy firearm.

* Belt Feed. If this firearm lacks the blast property, it ignores the reload property.
* Blast Shield. While you are holding this weapon you are not affected by the blast property on weapons and you have resistance to thunder damage.
* Bola Launcher. As an attack with this firearm, you can launch a bola at a creature. A bola functions similarly to a net, except that it is range 20/60, and you can make your normal number of attacks. You can reload this launcher over the course of a short or long rest.
* Chainsaw. This weapon also functions as a chainsaw for melee attack purposes, including opportunity attacks, except that it does not require a pull start in order to be used.
* Dead Man’s Switch. You can attach an explosive that requires an action to use to this firearm. If you are holding the firearm when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can activate the explosive at a point within your space. You can replace the explosive over the course of a short or long rest.
* Grapple Harpoon. This weapon can launch a harpoon at a target. It functions similarly to a spear gun except that it is range 30/60. When you hit a creature with a harpoon from this weapon, and the target is a creature your size or smaller, you can make a contested Strength (Athletics) check to pull it next to you and grapple it with a free hand. If there is no open adjacent space, then the creature stops in the nearest available open space and is not grappled. Alternatively, if the target is larger than you, you can choose to be pulled to it. However, this does not grapple it.
* Under-Barrel Rocket Launcher. This weapon also functions as a rocket launcher. This accessory is not compatible with other under-barrel accessories.

A firearm can have only 1 savage accessory, and you can maintain a number of savage accessories equal to your Rage Damage. If you attempt to add a savage accessory beyond your limit, you can choose which of your current savage accessories will break and become unusable.

If a creature other than you attempts to use one of your savage accessories or the firearm it is attached to, the attempt will fail and the firearm will malfunction, causing the creature to take 2d4 slashing or piercing damage (your choice).

#### ROAD RAGE
At 6th level, you become a fierce road warrior who gives new meaning to the term muscle car. If you enter a rage while you are driving a vehicle, the benefits of your rage also apply to your vehicle until the rage ends.

Your rage doesn’t end early if your vehicle has attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since your last turn. While you are driving a vehicle and raging, the vehicle can make ranged attacks using your Strength modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack rolls.

Additionally, you can control a vehicle without having a free hand for the vehicle’s controls.

#### BLAZE OF GLORY
At 10th level, when a vehicle you are driving is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction to have the vehicle move up to its movement speed. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. If a vehicle would explode when it is reduced to 0 hit points, the explosion occurs immediately after this movement.


Additionally, you gain resistance to fire damage and you take no damage from explosion effects caused by a vehicle or any other object reaching 0 hit points.

#### DEATH MACHINE
Beginning at 14th level, your adrenaline fueled rage allows you to maintain an iron grip on two weapons of mass destruction simultaneously. While you’re raging, you can ignore the two-handed property on all firearms. As a bonus action, you can engage in two-weapon fighting with any firearm.

### BARD: COLLEGE OF ANARCHY
The College of Anarchy is less a place and more a state of mind. It is a rejection of oppressive governments, of soulless megacorporations, and of any shithead that wants to tell you what to do. It is a statement of revolution against ‘The Man’, and all it represents.

The bards of this college tend to be loud, in both voice and appearance. The image of the punk rocker with a colorful mohawk and glowing LED tattoos is iconic, but the seed of rebellion can take root in even the most forgettable of office workers.

### COMMERCE DOMAIN
The gods of commerce oversee the trade of goods and services. These deities understand that business lubricates the gears of society and keeps everything running smoothly. Some gods see commerce as a force which must be regulated so that all may benefit from fair trade. Other gods see it as a competition, where the accrual of wealth and power are the goal. In the cutthroat world of megacorporations and massive economic inequality, the latter deities often hold greater sway.

Clerics of these gods put great stock in the open market and the true value of all things. A cleric’s station may range from the lowly accountant with dreams of starting their own business, to a ruthless mid-level executive looking to climb the ranks into the executive boardroom, or perhaps they're a rogue economist trying to bring balance to the commercial world.

| CLERIC LEVEL | SPELLS                                |

#### BONUS PROFICIENCIES
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan’s tools of your choice, and in one of the following specializations: Influence(Deception), History(choose), or Influence(Persuasion).

#### AGGRESSIVE BARGAINING
At 1st level, you can trade a bit of vital energy in order to twist fate. As a reaction, when you or a willing creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you and the willing creature can each choose to spend Hit Dice, up to a combined maximum of 4 Hit Dice. For each Hit Dice spent in this manner, the target adds 1d4 to the result. You can only use this ability after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

The object vanishes after 1 hour unless you magically spend an amount of credits you’re carrying equal to its value when you use this Channel Divinity. The object cannot be used as the material component for a spell unless you spend credits for it in this manner first.

#### POTENT SPELLCASTING
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### FREE TRADE
At 17th level, you can liquidate your vast supply of divine energy when you need it most. Once per turn, when you cast a spell on your turn that deals damage, you can expend 2 spell points to deal additional damage to one target of the spell. The extra damage is 1d8 for a 1st-level, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than the 1st, to a maximum of 4d8.

Alternatively, once per turn, when you cast a spell on your turn that restores hit points, you can expend 2 spell points to restore additional hit points to one target of the spell. The creature regains an extra 1d8 hit points for a 1st-level spell, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than the 1st, to a maximum of 4d8.


#### TECHNOLOGY DOMAIN
Gods of technology promote the ideals of invention, city building and science. Cities, electronic and mechanical devices are the example of their ideals, empowering everyone who uses the technology in their name.

| CLERIC LEVEL | SPELLS                                 |

### CIRCLE OF THE CITY
The Circle of the City is made up of druids living in cities to guard and to maintain the balance between nature and civilization. Druids of this circle do not reject technology and metal, but rather they are very pragmatic about the technology and objects they use.

#### BONUS PROFICIENCIES
Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with pistols (including pistols with rapid feature).

#### METAL WILD SHAPE
Also, at 2nd level, whenever you use your Wild Shape feature, your shape is made with metal and pieces of the city, more similar to a construct than a beast. While transformed, your AC increases by your proficiency bonus and the Constitution score of the shape increases by 2.

Starting at 6th level, the Constitution score of the shape increases by 4.

#### CONSTRUCT MIND
At 6th level, while transformed into a beast, you are considered a construct, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and your attacks count as magical for purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

At 8th level, the attack bonus increases to +2

#### CITY GUARDIAN
At 10th level, you can wild shape into a city guardian for 1 minute. After using this feature, you must finish a long rest to use it again. You can find the statistics of the city guardian later in this supplement.

#### TRUE CONSTRUCT
At 14th level, you cannot be charmed, paralyzed, petrified or poisoned and you are immune to poison and psychic damage. Additionally, you can wild shape into a city guardian twice before a long rest.

### CIRCLE OF TRANSFORMATION
Though the forests have been replaced by cities, the trees replaced by glittering steel spires, and the wayward paths replaced by neon-stained streets, some things never change. The land may look different, but those who look for a heart in the concrete jungle will find it beating to the rhythm of a combustion engine. Through the streets flows the blood of the city, a ceaseless tide of machines and life.

Where lovers of nature would give up and abandon these lands for greener pastures, others would appreciate the splendor of chrome and grime. The streets and skyscrapers have a will of their own, and a voice for those who will listen. They were paved and built with purpose, and those that would speak for the city shall know the strength in its foundations.

After all, in worlds both natural and artificial, one rule reigns supreme: survival of the fittest. Where clumsy beasts would be out of their element, druids of this circle shall find themselves at home. Where paw and hoof dare not tread, let wheels roll instead.

\pagebreakNum

#### METAL BEAST
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action, and you gain proficiency with Mechanic's kit.

Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend 2 spell slpointsot to increase your speed by 10 feet per level of the spell expended until the end of your current turn.

#### ALL-TERRAIN FORMS
The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into a variety of vehicles. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a sentient vehicle with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 4. For example, at 2nd level, you can transform into a vehicle with a challenge rating of 1/2, such as a motorcycle or jet ski.

When you transform, your vehicle form can have a melee weapon mount installed (you choose the type), per the vehicle modification (see Chapter 4). You can use your proficiency bonus instead of the vehicle's when making attacks with this weapon. You don't gain any of the vehicle's immunity to conditions.

You ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there. All creatures are treated as the same size as you for the purposes of determining crashing damage. If your form has an explosion effect when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you are not damaged by your explosion.

#### MYSTIC MUNITIONS
Starting at 6th level, your attacks in vehicle form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Additionally, when you transform into a Large or larger vehicle, you can have a ranged weapon mount installed with a gatling gun, assault cannon, or rocket launcher, per the vehicle modification. Ammunition for these weapons is magically created when you attack with them. You can use your proficiency bonus instead of the vehicle's when making attacks with these weapons.

#### MAYHEM SHAPE
At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into a sentient vehicle with a challenge rating as high 5.

At 14th level, you can transform into a sentient vehicle with a challenge rating as high as 6.

### Commando
A commando is a soldier of an elite light infantry or special operations force specialized in assault or unconventional high-value targets. Commandos differ from other types of special forces in that they primarily operate in covert combat, front-line reconnaissance, and raiding, rather than long range reconnaissance and unconventional warfare.

#### TACTICAL AID
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can give advantage to an ally on the next ability check or attack roll against an opponent you can see within 30 feet of you. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### PRE-PLANNING
Starting at 7th level, after spending 1 hour observing a specific location, you learn two pieces of information from the following options (your choice).

* Access. You discover a new way to access to the location. This can be an entry point such as an underground entrance through the sewers, an unlocked window in the 2nd floor, or the location of an item that can be used to enter (like a keycard).
* Alternative routes. You know some routes you can use to move within the location, such as the ventilation system or the underground tunnels.
* Dead Drop. You manage to get some of your equipment in a non-restricted area of the location, such as hidden inside a trash can in the laundry room or under a public bathroom sink. You can hide up to 20 lb. of equipment in one area within the location of your choice.
* Security Surveillance. You know the possible location of cameras, the security room, estimated number of guards, if there are metal detectors, ID checks, and so on.

\pagebreakNum

Additionally, while you are in the area you've studied, you have advantage on initiative rolls for the next 12 hours or until you use this feature again.

#### ADDITIONAL FIGHTING STYLE
At 10th level, you can choose a second option for the Fighting Style class feature.

#### RAPID STRIKE
Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you have advantage on a weapon attack against a target on your turn, you can forgo that advantage to immediately make an additional weapon attack against the same target as a bonus action.

#### FIRST CONTACT
At 18th level, if you take the Attack action on your first turn of a combat, you can make one additional ranged weapon attack as part of that action.

### Sharpshooter
The Sharpshooter is a master of ranged combat. An excellent sniper and eagle-eyed scout, this fighter is a perilous foe who can defeat an entire war band so long as they are kept at range.

#### STEADY AIM
Steady Aim Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your aim becomes deadly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can take careful aim at a creature you can see that is within range of a ranged weapon you’re wielding. Until the end of this turn, your ranged attacks with that weapon gain two benefits against the target:

* The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
* On each hit, the weapon deals additional damage to the target equal to 2 + half your fighter level.

You can use this feature up to a number of times equal to your dexterity modifier. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest. additionally, you can take the search action as a bonus action, because getting that as a 7th level ability is dumb.

#### CLOSE-QUARTERS SHOOTING
Close-Quarters Shooting At 7th level, you learn to handle yourself in close combat. Making a ranged attack roll while within 5 feet of an enemy doesn’t impose disadvantage on your roll.

#### HIT EM WHERE IT HURTS
Starting at 10th level your weapon attacks are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances. Additionally you may choose a damage type to make your attacks do that damage. Once chosen you cannot change this until a long rest.

#### STONE COLD STUNNER
Stone Cold Stunner at 15th level, you gain mastery of sowing confusion within your foes. When you hit a target, each creature within 5ft of the target must make a DC 12 plus your dex mod and half of your proficiency, CHA save. On failure, they lose the ability to take reactions and bonus actions.

#### SNAPSHOT
Snap Shot *Say Cheese*. at 18th level you gain a myriad of abilities that stem from your preparedness,
* If you take the Attack action on your first turn of a combat, you can make one additional ranged weapon attack as part of that action.
* If you are in stealth, have advantage (probably due to cover and stealth) and attack before the target, the first damage you deal to the target will be critical (this applies to each target that meets these requirement.)

### WAY OF THE PRIMAL FORCES
Monks of the Way of the Primal Forces are in tune with the chaotic forces of nature. The elements that compose the world and bind reality together are powerful tools for any that dare to attempt mastering them.

In an age where civilization has become untethered from the world it resides in, the primal powers seem irrelevant. It can be easy to discard the forces of water, earth, air, and fire from the comfort of an air-conditioned skyscraper, until a natural disaster serves a sharp reminder of one’s own insignificance in the universe.

By weaving together the elements, and shaping them with their will, monks of this tradition can become as unstoppable as the crushing tsunami, the raging earthquake, the swirling tempest, or the blazing wildfire.

#### SPELLCASTING
When you reach 3rd level, you can channel the primal elements to aid you. See below for the primal forces spell list.

Cantrips. You learn a cantrip of your choice from the primal forces spell list. You learn another primal forces cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the primal forces spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Primal Forces Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the primal forces spells you know and replace it with another spell from the primal forces spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your primal forces spells, since you learn your spells through your spiritual link to nature and the elements. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a primal forces spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

##### Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

##### Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spellcasting Focus. You can use a monk weapon as a spellcasting focus for your Primal Forces spells

#### ELEMENTAL BOND
Starting at 3rd level, you can begin weaving and shaping the elements of the world around you. Choose to learn one of the following cantrips: control flames, gust, mold earth, or shape water. You can choose an additional cantrip from this list at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. These cantrips don't count against your number of cantrips known.

#### FOCUSED CHAOS
At 3rd level, you can spend 1 ki point to cast a cantrip from your primal forces spell list or your Elemental Bond as a bonus action.

#### PRIMAL MARTIAL ARTS
At 6th level, your familiarity with the elements allows you to wield them as an extension of your limbs. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can choose to have your unarmed strikes deal cold, fire, thunder, or bludgeoning damage (your choice for each attack). When you do so, your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 10 feet until the end of your turn.

#### PRIMORDIAL MIGHT
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a primal forces spell of 1st-level or higher, you can cast that spell one level higher than the spell level you expend points for. For example, if you cast burning hands at 1st-level, then it is effectively cast at 2nd-level, and deals increased damage since it is cast at a higher level.

At 11th level, you can cast spells two levels higher than the spell level you expend points for, and at 17th level, you can cast spells three levels higher than the spell level you expend points for.

#### CHANNEL PRIMEVAL POWER
At 11th level, blending martial arts and primal powers comes second nature to you. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to cast a primal forces spell of 1st level or higher by spending ki equal to the level of the spell level cast.

#### HARNESS ELEMENTS
At 17th level, your mastery of the elements allows you to traverse them unhindered. As a bonus action, you can spend up to 4 ki points to gain a number of the following benefits of your choice for 10 minutes. The amount of benefits you can choose equals the number of ki points you spent.

Air. You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

Earth. You can move through solid earth or stone, but you can’t end your movement there. If you do so, you are ejected to the nearest unoccupied space, and you are stunned until the end of your next turn.

Fire. Your speed increases by 60 feet.

Water. You have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.

### WAY OF THE GUN FU
Monks of the Way of the Gun Fu are masters in the sophisticated close-quarters gunplay resembling a martial arts battle played out with firearms instead of traditional weapons.

The focus of gun fu is both style and the usage of firearms in ways that they were not designed to be used. Shooting a gun from each hand (usually paired with jumping to the side at the same time), shots from behind the back, as well as the use of guns as melee weapons are all common.

GUN FU TECHNIQUE
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with martial pistols. These weapons are monk weapons for you, and you gain the following benefits:

- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with firearms.
- Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn to make an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to make an additional ranged weapon attack with a firearm as a bonus action.

#### COUNTERSHOT
At 6th level, when an enemy misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make a single ranged weapon attack with a firearm against the attacker. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### GUN FU MASTERY
At 11th level, you gain proficiency with weapons that have the RAPID property and weapons that have the BURST property. These weapons are also considered as monk weapons for you.

Additionally, when you hit a target with a firearm which is a monk weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

#### BULLSEYE
At 17th level, your mastery of firearms grants you extraordinary accuracy. If you make an attack roll with a firearm which is a monk weapon for you and miss, you can reroll it. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

| 17th          | dominate person, hold monster               |

#### CHANNEL DIVINITY
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

Hunter of the Evil. You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with divine accuracy upon a creature. When you make an attack roll, you can also use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

Smite the Guilty. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on its attack rolls until the end of your next turn. Additionally, the creature can only take an action or bonus action on its next turn.

#### VIGILANT AURA
By 7th level, you and all friendly creatures within 10 feet of you cannot be surprised. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

#### STREET WATCH
Starting at 15th level, while in an urban environment, you can't be charmed and you have advantage on initiative rolls.

#### ETERNAL VIGILANT
At 20th level, as an action, you become an entity of true and divine judgment. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on attack rolls you make against creatures which have attacked you or a friendly creature in the last minute.
- You can use Smite the Guilty once per round as a bonus action without using your Channel Divinity.

### OATH OF PROGRESS
The Oath of Progress is a commitment to the betterment of society for current and future generations. In modern times, corporations recklessly pursue profit, basic rights are denied, and rifts divide populations into warring factions. Paladins seeking to shatter the boundaries between people and potential will swear an Oath of Progress.

Depending on the nature of obstacles they face, a paladin who swears this oath may be an activist, the leader of a revolution, or even a scientist searching for answers. However, progress never comes without sacrifice, and a warrior who disregards the damage they cause in pursuit of their goals may find the end was not worth the means after all.

\pagebreakNum

#### TENETS OF PROGRESS
The tenets of progress are a promise made to civilization, and they stand as ideals to uphold in the face of adversity.

- United We Stand. Where there is division and strife, you will unite disparate factions into a force to be reckoned with. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
- The Future is Now. You shall embrace advancement and change. Whether it be new discoveries, technological breakthroughs, or even a fresh point of view, it all leads to valuable growth.
- Discard Tradition. Those who cling to tradition and superstition are only holding themselves back. You must abandon old feuds and rivalries in order to keep moving forward.

| PALADIN LEVEL | SPELLS                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 3rd           | charm person, command               |
| 5th           | alter self, knock                   |
| 9th           | haste, tongues                      |
| 13th          | dimension door, freedom of movement |
| 17th          | passwall, greater restoration       |

#### CHANNEL DIVINITY
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

Bold Proclamation. You can use your Channel Divinity to captivate your fellow people with your presence. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes charmed for 10 minutes. The charmed creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, and can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns if it sees a hostile creature, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect ends for a creature if you damage it.

Ambitious Strike. You can use your Channel Divinity to gamble on a powerful blow. When you would hit with a weapon attack, you can instead use your Channel Divinity to make the attack again, ignoring advantage and disadvantage on the roll. If the attack still hits, it is a critical hit.

#### AURA OF PROGRESS
Beginning at 7th level, you inspire alacrity in yourself and your allies. Creatures of your choice that move within 10 feet of you or start their turn there can Dash as a bonus action until the end of their turn.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

#### OVERTHROW
At 15th level, when you hit another creature with a weapon attack, you can cause it to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is cursed for 1 minute. Add 1d4 to attack rolls against the cursed creature, and the cursed creature subtracts 1d4 from its saving throws.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Additionally, your Divine Sense feature can detect creatures that can speak at least one language, and you know what languages they speak.

#### PARAGON OF UNITY
At 20th level, your force of personality is strong enough to spark an unbreakable alliance. As an action, you can become an unstoppable icon, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you deals an extra 1d6 force damage when it hits with an attack.
- When a creature other than yourself that you can see within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, but is not killed outright, you can use your reaction to drop it to 1 hit point instead.
- You and creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you can ignore difficult terrain.
  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### OATH OF THE GUARDIAN (25 Era)

#### Tenets of the Guardian
- Defenders of the Peace
- The Synthar are a blight that must be extinguished
- The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few

\pagebreakNum

#### Guardians Mark
Starting at 3rd level when you take this oath you gain Guardians Mark.
- Guardians Mark. As a bonus action you can mark a foe designating one creature you can see within 10 feet of you as your prey for 1 minute. You have advantage on attack rolls against the creature. If the target drops to 0 hit points, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn to mark a new creature. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level you gain new ways to use your channel divinity.

- Snap Aggression. If you are surprised at the start of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to act normally on your first turn.
- Assertive Defense. When you reduce the damage dealt by a ranged attack to 0 using the Blade Deflect power, and you’re wielding a Starsword, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to reflect the attack at a target within range, regardless of what type the damage is.

#### Starsword
Starting at 3rd level you become proficient in the Starsword and are able to craft one yourself using 6 Spell points a day for one week. Once crafted it persists, and you can summon it to your hand from anywhere in the galaxy. It takes the hilt shape you desire (two handed, one handed, finesse, light), and the blade of pure Astra (Star energy) is a color of your choosing from the color of any star but typically is yellow. You can have two of these at a time but if ever wielded by someone else they disappear but can be resummoned by you.

| Name      | Property                     | Cost | Weight | Damage              |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ------------------- |
| Starsword | Finesse, Versatile, Luminous | -    | 2 lbs  | 1d8/1d10 Ion/Energy |

The Starsword blade is made of pure energy. For the purposes of vulnerabilities it is both an Ion weapon and a weapon of the Energy damage type. Forged by you from the very chaotic energies of the universe that started the entire process off, the essence of stars themselves.

#### Blade Deflect
Starting at 3rd level when wielding a Starsword you can use "Blade Deflect" and reduce incoming ranged damage by 1d6 per spell point spent this is a reaction up to 5d6. This is a reaction.

#### Relentless
Starting at 7th level you have advantage on initiative checks, and gain a 10 foot bonus to your speed on your first turn of combat.

#### Devastating Critical
At 15th level When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you gain a bonus to that weapon’s damage roll equal to your guardian level.

#### Paragon Guardian
At 20th level you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Your Strength and Dexterity scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2
- You have resistance to all damage.
- When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.
- Your critical hit range with weapons increases by 1.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.

## Ranger

- Tools: none
- Saving Throws: Strength, Dexterity
- Skills: Replaced by profession system

### Starting Equipment

### DRONE MASTER
For some, the lure of high-tech gadgetry, mechanized limbs, and shiny chrome is too much to avoid. Drones are a part of most modern corporate security systems, and for good reason. Drones don’t complain, they don’t get sick, and they don’t betray you to your business rivals. In a firefight, the best companion to have at your back is the one who will listen to and obey your orders unquestioningly.

The Drone Master is a different sort of breed. While they can produce cold, pitiless killing machines as effectively as any megacorp, some have opted for something more. Using a form of magically implanted artificial intelligence, they can instill consciousness in their drones, and some have even developed personalities. It’s a brave new world, one where the people may soon find themselves outdated by machinery.

#### TOOL PROFICIENCY
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Mechanic's kit. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

\pagebreakNum

#### DRONE MASTER MAGIC
At 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Drone Master Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

| RANGER LEVEL | SPELLS          |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| 3rd          | catapult        |
| 5th          | heat metal      |
| 9th          | fly             |
| 13th         | fabricate       |
| 17th         | animate objects |

#### CHIMERA DRONE
At 3rd level, you have engineered a robot with synthetic materials, machine parts, and refined oil, then magically infused it with life and sentience. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the chimera drone stat block. You determine the build and style of the drone and whether it moves on legs, wheels, or treads; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.

In combat, the chimera drone shares your initiative count, but takes its turn immediately after yours. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the drone to use its reaction to make an attack instead. If the drone has died within the last hour, you can use your Mechanic's kit as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell points of 1st level or higher. The chimera drone returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

At the end of a long rest, you can create a new chimera drone if you have your Mechanic's kit with you. If you already have a chimera drone from this feature, the first one immediately perishes.

#### LOADOUT
By 3rd level, you have developed combat and utility attachments for your drone. Choose two of the following attachments to modify your chimera drone.

- Hacker-Bot. When the drone makes an ability check with electrician’s kit or hacking tools it can add your proficiency bonus to the roll, and the drone gains the benefits of having the hacking tools augment installed. As a bonus action, the drone can launch a built in universal cable up to 30 feet to connect itself to a port it can see.
- Primed Shot. The drone can use its primed shot attack.
- Razor Claws. The drone can use its razor claws attack.
- Serum Shot. You can use your bonus action to cause a creature of your choice within 30 feet of the drone that it can see to regain hit points equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.
- Shock Prod. The drone can use its shock prod attack.

Over the course of a long rest, you can replace your chimera drone’s attachments with two attachments of your choice.

#### UPGRADE
At 7th level, you have refined your engineering to improve your drone’s attachments. Each attachment gains its respective additional abilities or effects.

- Hacker-Bot. As an action, the drone can cause an EMP at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Machines, constructs, and vehicles within 30-foot-radius of that point are subjected to EMP. Machines in the area cease to function for 1 minute. Constructs in the area with the Electronics feature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or they are stunned until the end of your next turn. Vehicles in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or its movement speed is reduced to 0 and can’t take actions or reactions until the end of the drone’s next turn.
 
Additionally, wireless and radio connections within a 100-foot-radius radius of the point are suppressed for 1 minute.
 Once the drone uses this ability, it must finish a short or long rest before it can use it again.
- Primed Shot. A target hit by this attack begins burning for 1 minute, so long as it is not already burning from this attack, and takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
- Razor Claws. The drone can grapple a creature up to one size larger than it hit by this attack. Until this grapple ends, the chimera drone can’t use its razor claws against another target.
- Serum Shot. Instead of regaining hit points, this ability can end either one disease or one condition for the creature. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned.
- Shock Prod. A creature hit by this attack can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn and its speed is reduced by 10 feet.

Additionally, the drone's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### CYBERDEMON
At 11th level, through a combination of magic and machinery, your chimera drone has achieved the cutting edge of technological superiority. You can choose one of the following advanced attachments to modify your chimera drone.

- Anti-Grav Boosters. Your drone gains a flying speed of 80 feet and the ability to hover. It gains a +2 bonus to its AC.
- Hijack Module. Your drone can cast commandeer vehicle using your spell save DC and requiring no components. Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again until it finishes a long rest. If your drone has the Hacker-Bot attachment, it can add double your proficiency bonus to ability checks made with its hacking tools.

\pagebreakNum

- Mobile Unit. Your drone becomes a Medium size sentient vehicle that can hold 1 rider. Its walking speed changes to 120 feet and its climbing speed changes to 60 feet. Its hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your ranger level.

Over the course of a long rest, you can replace your chimera drone’s advanced attachment with one attachment of your choice.

#### MASTER’S CALL.
At 15th level, the bond between you and your chimera drone has become second-nature and you can call your drone to defend you in your moments of need.

When a creature you can see attacks you, you can use your reaction to have your drone move up to half its movement speed. At the end of this movement, if the drone is within 5 feet of you, you can force the attack to target the drone instead. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks

### SHADOW HUNTER CONCLAVE
The Shadow Hunter is a tracker, a stalker, a finder of lost things and people—particularly those that do not want to be found. The Shadow Hunter is familiar with all the modern forensics methods of tracking a subject, but places equal faith in magic and supernatural methods.

#### TARGET CREATURE
At 3rd level, you may spend 10 minutes to designate a creature as your target. You don't need to know the target personally and you can designate the creature only through her actions or a description, such as "the orc from the bank heist". You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your targeted creature, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about it. Once you choose a target you must finish a long rest before choosing another.

#### NO TRACE
At 7th level, you have advantage on checks you make to hide and avoid being detected while you are in your favored terrain or an urban environment. Additionally, while you are tracking your target, you can move stealthily at a normal pace and enemies have disadvantage on Perception checks to track you.

#### PLAY A HUNCH
At 11th level, you can use your action and expend 2 spell points to determine whether an assumption, hunch, or guess is correct. When you do so, you must state the assertion (such "He has left the building", or "The mayor is an evil man"). Then, the DM rolls a percentile dice. There is a 70% + 1% per ranger level chance of getting a response on the hunch. If the roll is a success, the DM lets the player know if the hunch is true, false, both or neither. A "both" response is possible for vague assumptions such as "the mayor is an evil man", which can be both true and false (he is evil, but not human). An "unknown" response is for questions with no immediate answer. The DM may determine that the hunch is so obvious that it does not require a roll, or that is so vague that there is no chance for success.

A hunch does not translate as a legal truth, and will not stand up in a court of law. Rather it is an obvious fact to the Shadow Hunter alone. Finding proof of an assumption such as "the mayor is a mind flayer" would require additional work.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### LOCATE TARGET
At 15th level, you gain the supernatural ability to know where your target is. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense your targeted creature's location if it is within 3 miles of you, and if it's moving, you know the direction of its movement. This ability applies only on the target, and does not reveal attitude, status, or the presence of others around the target.

After you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

## Rogue

### Proficiencies
- Armor: light armor
- Weapons: all simple weapons, choice of 2 martial ranged, shortblades, sabre
- Tools: Security Kit

- Skills: Replaced by profession system

\pagebreakNum

### INFILTRATOR
An infiltrator is a master of stealth who can break into places others wouldn't dream of, find what it's looking for, and get back out again while eluding or evading anyone who would try to stop him.

#### BONUS PROFICIENCIES
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and hacking tools.

#### SWEEP
Starting at 3rd level, you know how to size up an area and get the lay of the land in a single sweep of your eyes that often isn't perceptible to those around you.

You can use your bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make the Search action. You also gain advantage on the check when looking for alarms, surveillance devices, escape routes and any expensive objects that can easily be concealed and carried away.

#### INFILTRATION ADEPT
At 9th level, you have a number of infiltration dice equal to your Dexterity modifier, which are d8s. You regain all of your expended infiltration dice when you finish a short or long rest. You can use an infiltration dice and add it to the result for the following checks after you roll, but before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

- Whenever you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.
- Whenever you make an attack roll while hiding.
- Whenever you make a check using, disarming or repairing an electrical or mechanical device.

#### ENGINEER
At 13th level, you understand how machines and electrical devices work. You gain advantage on checks to use, disarm or repair an electrical or mechanical devices.

Additionally, when you fail to deactivate a trap, explosive or alarm, you can use your reaction to avoid triggering the effect (activating the trap, detonate an explosive or trigger an alarm). After you use your reaction for this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

#### MASTER INFILTRATOR
At 17th level, your infiltration dice are now d10s, and you can use up to two infiltration dices for each check.

In addition, whenever you make a check using tools you are not proficient, you can add half your proficiency bonus to that roll.

### SABOTEUR
There are countless situations where sabotage, terrorism, catastrophic failure, and bombings have changed the course of history. A true Saboteur knows that any goal is achievable with enough explosives. If a job has a car that needs stopping, a skyscraper that needs dropping, or a person that needs popping, then look no further.

The real challenge for the Saboteur is knowing when to stop. Some saboteurs let the force multipliers at their fingertips go to their head, becoming a mad bomber. In these cases, self-destruction is inevitable, but at least it’s always one hell of a fireworks show.

#### BOMBARDIER
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the grenade launcher, rocket launcher, and demolition kit. When you make an attack with a blast weapon with which you are proficient, you can choose which targets other than the primary target are affected by the weapon’s blast property.

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you can use Sneak Attack against objects and vehicles as long as you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

> DM TIP: BLAST SNEAK ATTACK
> Sneak Attack does not apply to blast damage on targets other than the primary target. Only the weapon’s damage roll applies to the blast firearm property.

#### HAIR TRIGGER
At 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to use any explosive that can be used as an action, or to use your demolition kit to disarm explosives.

#### BLASTJUMPER
At 9th level, you can give yourself a blast-propelled boost of speed. You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to expend one ammunition from a weapon with the blast property you are holding. You immediately fly up to 40 feet in a straight line in any direction. If you are not on the ground at the end of the movement, you fall.

Additionally, you gain resistance to thunder damage and can fall up to 40 feet without taking damage.

#### EMERGENT ORDNANCE
Beginning at 13th level, using your demolition kit, you can create special improvised explosive devices (IED) with supplies you carry and gather from the environment around you. Each IED functions similarly to an explosive but is unstable, and falls apart after 24 hours unless maintained.

Over the course of a long rest, you can expend a number ordnance points equal to your twice proficiency bonus to create or maintain IEDS. The Ordnance Points table shows the cost of creating or maintaining each type and tier of explosive.

\pagebreakNum

| Grenade, incendiary (2d10 Fire)        | 3          |


#### MAD BOMBER
At 17th level, you gain the ability to unleash a hail of charges on groups of foes. As an action, you can make up to 5 attacks with weapons with the blast property, provided that each attack targets a different creature. As part of each attack, you can draw a weapon. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### NUCLEAR
The atom is the building block of the universe. Locked inside is a limitless font of power, waiting to be unleashed. Many who have bathed in the deadly embrace of radiation have crumbled, but some select few of the survivors may find themselves irrevocably altered. A sorcerer tainted by radiation can become a nuclear powerhouse, so long as they can avoid melting down.

#### RADIOACTIVE
At 1st level, your inner glow grants you an internal powerhouse from which to draw magic. You gain resistance to radiant damage, advantage on saving throws against being irradiated, and you learn the Light cantrip if you don’t already know it.

In addition, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Nuclear Spells table. The spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

| SORCERER LEVEL | SPELLS              |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| 1st            | faerie fire         |
| 3rd            | ray of enfeeblement |
| 5th            | fireball            |
| 7th            | sickening radiance  |
| 9th            | antilife shell      |

\pagebreakNum

#### REACTOR
Starting at 1st level, you can harness your atomic energy to expand your magical influence. When you cast a sorcerer spell that creates an effect in a cone, a sphere, or a cube, you can choose to increase the size of the effect by 5 feet. For example, when the fireball spell affects a 20-foot radius sphere, you can increase it to a 25-foot radius sphere.

At 14th level, you can increase the size of the effect by 10 feet.

#### FALLOUT
At 6th level, your magic carries traces of withering radiation. Once per turn, when you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher on your turn, you can cause one creature targeted by the spell to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target suffers one level of irradiated, to a maximum of level 3.

Additionally, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change that damage type to fire or radiant.

#### SPECTRUM SPECTRE
Starting at 6th level, you can manipulate the spectrum of light you create. When you cast a spell that sheds light, you can designate any number of creatures within 90 feet of you to be able to see that light. It is invisible to others. Spells, features, and effects that require dim light or darkness do not function in invisible bright or dim light, as usual. This light can be detected by truesight.

Alternatively, when you cast a spell that sheds light, you can make that light sunlight.

#### QUANTUM JUMP
At 14th level, as a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Immediately after you disappear, a wave of radiation spreads within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the space you left for 1 minute. When a creature moves into the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### UNSTABLE FISSION
At 18th level, you can split your own atoms into the form of an unstable twin of yourself. You can cast simulacrum with a casting time of 1 action, a range of self, and requiring no components. A simulacrum created in this manner cannot cast cantrips, and cannot use spell slots higher than 3rd level.

When the simulacrum is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 1 minute, it explodes, and targets within 30 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A target takes 3d10 thunder damage and 3d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

### THE NETWORK
Your innate magic comes from the energy of the massive network around the world where every device is connected. Perhaps the constant exposure to this network through using devices connected to the internet gave you your powers.

#### SOCIAL NETWORK
Starting at 1st level, your innate connection allows you to get information easily. Whenever you make an Intelligence check to learn or get information about someone or something, you may use your Charisma modifier instead.

#### NETWORK STRIKES
When you choose this origin at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Whenever you deal damage with a spell, you can replace the damage type to lightning damage.
- Any creature within 30 feet of you that you can see that hits you with an attack takes lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
- Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

#### ARCANE FIREWALL
At 6th level, whenever you are targeted by a spell that makes you roll a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 1 sorcery point to gain advantage on that roll.

On the other hand, if you are targeted by a ranged spell attack, you can use your reaction and spend 1 sorcery point to impose disadvantage on that roll.

#### METAMAGIC GLITCH
At 14th level, when you cast a spell using a 4th level slot or higher, you can choose one metamagic option you know from Careful, Distant, Empowered, Extended or Subtle spell. You use that metamagic option at no cost.

#### NETWORK OVERLOAD
Beginning at 18th level, when you cast a spell that requires an attack roll against a single objective, you can expend up to 4 sorcery points to deal an additional 1d10 lightning damage for each sorcery point you expend.

### THE SUPERINTELLIGENCE
Your patron is a very powerful and independent Artificial Intelligence. You are not completely sure how it was originated: some warlocks say it was created as an overlord for the network, and others say it was created by the massive interactions through the digital world.

#### EXPANDED SPELL LIST
The Superintelligence lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| SPELL LEVEL | SPELLS                                |

| 5th         | instant connectivity*, synchronicity* |


#### SUPERNATURAL HACKER
Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency with hacking tools and when you make a roll to use an electronic device, you can use your Charisma modifier instead.

#### AI SERVANT
Also at 1st level, you gain the service of a mechanical construct powered by a basic AI sent by the Superintelligence to aid you. This AI is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the accompanying AI Servant stat block. You can determine the cosmetic characteristics of the AI, such as its form, its color, or any visible effect; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.

As a bonus action, you can command your AI to left its physical form and travel to an electronic device within 100 feet from you that you can see, allowing your AI to use that device. The AI can add your proficiency bonus on any Intelligence check related to using an electronic device.

If the AI is destroyed, you can build a new one with 8 hours of uninterrupted work and spending $10 in raw materials.

#### DIGITAL CONNECTION
At 6th level, you can you can cast any spell with the technomagic tag through your AI. In addition, you can use your action and concentrate to merge your mind with your AI, allowing you to travel and use any electronic device within 100 feet from you that you can see for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

#### SPELL HACKING
At 10th level, as a bonus action, you can spend 4 spell points and gain resistance against any damage dealt by spells for 1 minute.

#### CREATURE HACKING
Starting at 14th level, you hack a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to weaken its defenses and make it more vulnerable to magic. The creature you choose must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on saving throws against spells and it takes double damage from spells for 1 minute. The creature can make another saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end this effect.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### FANDOM
A fandom is a capricious force, a collection of people with whom you have a connection. Perhaps you were an entertaining jokester, a serious force of personality, or a hateable asshole. Regardless, you have become the center of attention. If deities gain their power through worship, then you gain yours through viewership.

Whether through ritual or pact, you forged this connection, and now your fate is intertwined with your audience. Of course, fandoms are a fickle force, and are quick to abandon those that fail to fascinate them. So, be a rowdy game streamer, a flirtatious hottie, a righteous reporter, a director of Internet drama.

Be anything, except boring.

#### EXPANDED SPELL LIST
The Fandom lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| SPELL LEVEL | SPELLS                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1st         | guiding bolt, hideous laughter |
| 2nd         | enhance ability, mind spike    |
| 3rd         | catnap, spirit guardians       |
| 4th         | compulsion, resilient sphere   |
| 5th         | dominate person, modify memory |

#### ALWAYS ONLINE
Starting at 1st level, you gain the benefits of having a sense-log augment installed without requiring surgery or counting against your total number of augments installed. The data you record can be magically uploaded in real-time to the internet and broadcasted online to viewers on your streaming platform of choice.

Additionally, you learn the vicious mockery cantrip. It counts as a warlock cantrip for you, but it doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.

#### FANDOM’S FAVOR
At 1st level, you can attempt to sway your fickle fandom into granting you aid. As a bonus action, you can choose a Favor from the Fandom’s Favor table. Make a Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Performance), or Charisma (Persuasion) check against the Favor’s DC. On a successful check, the effects of that Favor occur.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

| FAVOR     | DC  | EFFECT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### LARGER THAN LIFE
At 6th level, you can exaggerate or accentuate your personality while surrendering your dignity or sanity. When you make a Charisma ability check you can choose to roll an additional d20 after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the ability check, and you take psychic damage equal to half your warlock level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

#### MARATHONER
At 10th level, you can ignore the effects of the exhaustion condition until you suffer level 6 exhaustion. At level 6 exhaustion, you die.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws.

#### CULT OF PERSONALITY
At 14th level, you can harness the unpredictable and dangerous passion your fandom has for you into a physical manifestation. As an action, you summon a Swarm of Fandom in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. It is a swarm of tiny celestial, fey, or fiend creatures (your choice). The swarm disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, or after 1 minute.

\pagebreakNum

Roll initiative for the swarm, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can issue a verbal command to it as a bonus action, telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn pursuing and attacking the nearest creature that has damaged it.

If you lose concentration, your control of the swarm ends for the rest of the duration, and the swarm spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest creatures to the best of its ability. As an action, you can dismiss the swarm, causing it to disappear. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

### SCHOOL OF TECHNOMANCY
A new world brings new opportunities as the magical and the mundane fuse into novel patterns. The technomage combines the rising power of magic with a deep understanding of technology.

#### TECHNOMANCY SAVANT
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you change your spellbook into a E-book device infused with magic, allowing you to save spells on it in a special format called "spellfiles". The cost or the time you must spend to copy a spell in your E-book device is halved (your choice).

\pagebreakNum

#### PROGRAM SPELL
At 6th level, you can cast a 5th-level spell or lower with a casting time of 1 action while you're touching an electronic device. When you do so, you spend the spell points and the material components (if any), but none of the spell effects occur. Instead, the spell is uploaded into the device for later use. You determine the method of activating the spell, such as typing a specific word, flicking a switch or similar. If the device already have a spell programmed, you cannot use this feature in that device until the previous spell is used or dismissed.

After that, a creature that has an Intelligence score of at least 6 can use an action to activate the spell and cast the programmed spell in the device. The creature must know the method of activation to cast the spell (for example, you can program the haste spell to be casted in a creature when it hits Control-Alt-H in the keyboard). A concentration spell placed in a device cannot be activated if you are concentrating on another spell.

When you program a spell in this way, it must be used within 8 hours. After that time, the magic fades and is wasted. The programmed spell is also lost if the device is destroyed or after you finish a long rest.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### ONLINE CASTING
At 10th level, you can cast certain spells through electronic devices, including cameras, smartphones, tablets, computers, and so on by following this rules.

The range is determined from you to the device and then from the device to your target.
If the spell requires you to see your target, you must be able to see it directly in order to cast it. This also applies if the spell requires the target to see or hear you. If the device have a camera, a screen or speakers, you can try to hack and gain access to these parts for casting your spells.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain your expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### DOWNLOAD SPELL
At 14th level, you can download temporary spellfiles into your E-book device to cast them once.

When you prepare your spells, you can choose two spells of 4th level or lower you know. These spells don't count against the total number of spells you can prepare and you can cast each of them once without expending a spell point until you finish a long rest.

# Profession System
In Astra Genesis you take on the role of a adventurer trekking across the stars, you are not heroes per se but some people may consider you as such. These Adventurers are called Starstrider. Starstriders do the work that must get done in the galaxy, even if no one wants to talk about it. Bounty hunting, murder for hire, corporate espionage, smuggling, piracy, all of these and more are done by Astra Genesis every moment of every day throughough the known galaxy.

You are one of those Starstriders. But who were you *before* you becamse a furious Android Barbarian, or cunning Rogue?

> Game Designer: To be clear. Class only advances by Milestone. The Profession system ***COMPLETELY*** replaces the skill system in 5e. This system has some cross over. Your attribute modifier and your Proficiency modifer do play a role in your skills by giving you a greater margin for error in your rolls. 

Your profession is often separate from your Class. A class represents combat training. Your profession represents what your characters professional training.

Put simply: Class comes into play in Ground Combat just following 5e rules. Profession comes into play outside combat more skill based (and also starship combat).

> Game Designer: 
> 
> Advantage. If something says you get Advantage on a skill check you roll an additional d20 
> 
> Disadvantage. If something says you get Disadvantage on a skill check you take away a d20.
> 
> Expertise. If something says you get Expertise such as a Rogue you apply your Proficiency modifier twice as usual.
> 
> Jack of All Trades. Works nearly exactly as it does in 5e. Normally you cannot add your proficiency modifier to skills without being proficient. In Astra Genesis you are proficient (at least 1) in all six disciplines, with Jack of All Trades you can add half rounded down minimum 1 to your skill checks in addition to your other modifiers
> 
> Reliable Talent. Works exactly like it does in 5e you cannot roll lower than a 9. However a roll of a 1 on a D20 is still a complication (see new rules.)

## Step 0: Intro
Lets do your attributes. They all start at 8. You will have points to spend later for now lets progress from here

## Step 1: Your species
You already chose your species. Your traits come from your species. They apply as Broad focuses (more in new rules). 

- Apply your species bonuses. 

## Step 2: Childhood
- Eventually something cool will happen here
- Crate 1 Value
- For now spend 6 attribute points, nothing higher than 15.

## Step 3: Environment
- Eventually something cool will happen here
- Create 1 Value
- For now spend 6 attribute points, nothing higher than 15.

## Step 4: Backgrounds
Write down whatever label you want for your background. Fold it into your backstory. Were you Orphaned as a child? Put that in there and pick skills that make sense for an Orphaned Child. Work with your gamemaster. The removal of "Background Features" is replaced by the addition of a FEAT. 

- Eventually something cool will happen here
- For now spend 6 attribute points, nothing higher than 15.
* You get a Feat choice do this after you finish Step 6.
* Pick 3 Focuses
* Create 1 Value

> Game Designer: What do 5th Edition backgrounds all have in common? No one cares. I have played 5th edition since its inception and DM'd over 2000 hours of it and I have almost never seen someone *use* their background feature. But feats like Lucky? Every day.

\pagebreakNum

## Step 5: Professional Development
Profesional development represents what career your character had (and in some cases may still do). If there is not one that suits your character vision work with your gamemaster to make one. While there is not one for Rimworld Lawkeeper or a Computer Slicer, your gamemaster could definitely assist you in coming up with what that looks like.

- Spend your final 6 attribute points here. Nothing higher than a 17 and nothing lower than an 8.
- All 6 disciplines start at 1, you get 10 points to spend and nothing can be higher than 5.
- Pick 3 Focuses
- Create 1 Value
- Gain 1 Contact or 1 Free Language


### Step 6: Final Checks
- You should have 75 attributes if you are an Android you will have 74. Nothing should be higher than a 17 and nothing should be lower than 8.
- You have 16 in your skills with nothing higher than 5 and nothing lower than 1.
- You should have 4 Values
- You should have 6 Focuses
- You should have 1 Contact or 1 Free Language
- You should have racial traits, and a trait from your class
- You have 1 feat to pick.

Pick your Feat. This could raise an attribute to 18 which is fine now.

## Traits
You typically have 2 of these (Species and Class). Occasionally you can get others like Rank or Position such as Starship Captain.

Traits are very broad Values. It covers the fact that you should know your language, history, and background of your species without needing to spend anything. It also covers situations where being a Species or a Specific class can be invoked either for your benefit or against you.

## Values
You have 4 of these.

A value is a core concept, or cornerstone of your character. In 5e these were Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws. They almost never serve a purpose so they are replaced in Astra Genesis with Values. Written as a guideline about your character they come into play using Heroism later. Values are neutral they can be for you and against you.

# Skills

Making a skill check

- Roll xd20. (Typically 2d20 somthing 1d20 with disadvantage and sometimes 3d20 with advantage)
- Each d20 gets your Attribute modifier + Discipline Rating + Proficiency Modifier + Misc Bonuses add to it
- The standard DC in Astra Genesis (called Baseline is 20) you compare each dice against 20 if you met or exceeded 20 you got a success
- If you rolled a 20 you automatically get 2 success
- If you rolled a 1 you get a complication (more on that in New Rules) regardless of the total (though you may still succeed)

> Game Designer: Why multiple d20 and a weird success system and not 1d20? Because I want to. "Some men master Wayne like to watch the world burn"

## Skill Points By Level

You will gain 1 skill point when you gain a proficiency bonus. Remember no skill can exceed 5. And no discipline can be less than 1.

| Level | Skill Points |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 1     | 16           |

| 19    | 20           |
| 20    | 20           |

\pagebreakNum

This means at 17 you could have 3 of your disciplines at 5, 2 at 2 and 1 at 1. Or however you want to spread them around.

### Skill Ratings
| Rating | Meaning                                                                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0      | Untrained, unskilled, lacking in innate aptitude                                                 |
| 1      | Basic training, rudimentary skill, or a raw but undeveloped aptitude.                            |
| 2      | Professional competence, from a combination of training and talent.                              |
| 3      | Experienced and well-trained, or an aptitude developed through study and training.               |
| 4      | Excellence within the field, achievable through dedication and experience.                       |
| 5      | Exceptional, often a combination of intense training, hard-won experience, and natural aptitude. |

> Why only 6 skills? 

> When I started off writing this system I had about 40 skills, they got trimmed to 25. As we play tested it became obvious several things with spending skill points meant you were going to default to your Discipline alot. If you could add your proficiency modifier to your disciplines ... well then you had 36 possible permutations because Disciplines were not attacked to a specific skill. Suddenly the game became so much more free and open. The player could make Social + Physical tests for Intimidation, they could make Technical + Dexterity checks to pick a lock and Technical + Intelligence checks to bypass a keypad lock. They could use Social + Intelligence to blend in with a science team for espionage and use Social + Charisma to be charming enough to talk the bartender into letting them upstairs. They were no longer **locked** into the concept of Attribute + Skill. It became collaborative, as gamemaster I would give a check and on occasion the player would say "I am thinking of doing it this way" and I would change the Discipline or the Attribue involved. 


## Focuses
You have 6 of these.

Each skill represents a somewhat broad area, a focus allows you to narrow that down and give a specific area that your character has knowledge in. Having an applicapble Focus for a skill check will provide you with Advantage to the roll if you already have Advantage this does not apply, if you have Disadvantage it counters that and makes the roll straight. 

> Keep in mind Advantage adds a d20 and Disadvantage takes it away.

## Disciplines
The six disciplines (Mental, Phyiscal, Observational, Operational, Social and Technical) represent very broad categories of education, training, and natural talent. Your rating in this discipline represents a broad area of education, training, natural aptitude, and capabilities. While it might feel limiting having only 6 Disciplines, when you have 6 Attrbiutes that get mix and matched with them frequently it broadens the horizon much more than traditional 5e Attribute locked skills. With the concept of multiple success it defines difficulty having a fixed Difficulty number

## Progression
As your character levels you gain the following benefits.

- 1 Discipline rating each time your profiency modifier goes up (5,9,13,17) to apply to a Discipline
- You can swap out Focuses
- You can move 1 discipline rating around. Never anything higher than 5 or lower than 1.
- The additional benefits of leveling up in your class.
- **IF** you invoked or were compelled to use a Value during that level you can change Values or evolve them.

# Equipment
FROM THE GRAND SUPERMALLS THAT GRACE THE SHOPPING districts of major cities to the electronic vendor stations along the halls of almost every space station, shopping is a part of everyday life in almost every populated area in the galaxy. Goods and services of all types, styles, shapes and sizes can be found almost anywhere either physically or online through the Silrayne Intergalactic Matrix. Massive megacorporations push their ads across all networks. Some manufacturers compete to make the best, most cost effective gear for daily consumption, while others specialize in high-grade luxury items or vehicles. For those who brave the dangers of the deep expanse, the right piece of gear at the right time could mean the difference between life and death.

This chapter covers the different types of common and exotic gear, goods, and services your character may find useful during their exploits.

## Currency
The standard form of galactic currency is the credit (abbreviated as c). It is primarily used as a digital currency, accepted anywhere by online transfer within the core planets. For trade outside the core, however, the credit also has a physical representation: that of a flat metallic disc (a coin) made of pressed meteoric ore harvested from several planets within the galaxy.

For a conversion rate from standard 5e 1 Silver Piece (1sp) = 1 Credit

## Selling Loot
Opportunities abound to find treasure, gear, weapons, armor, and more during your expeditions. Normally, you can sell your gains when you return to a space station or populated settlement, provided that you can find buyers interested in your loot.

Arms, Armor, and Gear: As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in trade. Weapons and armor used by defeated enemies are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

Enhanced Gear and Core Stones: Selling these rare items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a more common item isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest citizens and merchants. Likewise, aside from a few common gear enhancements and stones, you won’t normally come across these items for normal purchase. The value of high-grade tech and sorium core stones is far beyond the standard level of trade and should always be treated as such.

Gems, Jewelry, and Collectibles: These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for money or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a city or a major spaceport.

Trade Goods: On the fringes, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—ore, foodstuffs, gear parts, medicine, and so on—retain their full value in trade and can be used as a form of currency.


# Armor

There are many different styles of armor that vary between different cultures, races, and manufacturers. The different types are classified below. Due to the advancements in weapons manufacturing, armor has become an absolute necessity for anyone traveling beyond the reaches of civilization. Exploring the expanse without at least a shield generator is a risky proposition indeed.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in Starstriders.

**Armor Proficiency.** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t use Magic (Astra).

**Armor Class (AC).** Armor protects its wearer from
attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines
your base Armor Class.

**Heavy Armor.** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**Stealth.** If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Shields.** A shield is made from metal, polymer, energy, or reinforced glass, and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

\pagebreakNum

### Light Armor
Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

- Flight Suit. A layered set of clothing that provides basic protection from harsh climates.
- Armor Jacket. Lined with a protective mesh, this light jacket provides adequate protection while still allowing full movement without restriction.
- Light Trooper. A padded suit with a hardened flexible overlay. Standard issue for most grunts.
- Infiltration Suit. A full body suit made from high grade polymer blends. Expensive but effective.
- Emergency EV Suit. A full body suit with helmet, while wearing it you are protected from the hazards associated with low pressure environments and air toxins. Lasts 4 hours of air. While wearing this suit, you are immune to poison and disease, however, your movement rate is halved and you cannot take reactions.

| Name              | Cost | Weight | AC                | Stealth      |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------ | ----------------- | ------------ |
| Flight Suit       | 50   | 3      | 11 + Dex Modifier | Disadvantage |
| Armor Jacket      | 100  | 5      | 11 + Dex Modifier | -            |
| Light Trooper     | 450  | 10     | 12 + Dex Modifier | Disadvantage |
| Infiltration Suit | 1200 | 5      | 12 + Dex Modifier | -            |
| Emergency EV Suit | 150  | 10     | 11 + Dex Modifier | Disadvantage |


### Medium Armor
Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

Reinforced Mesh: Multiple layers of micro-woven fiber mesh. It most often comes in the form of a vest or torso covering.

Military Jacket. Popular amongst officers and mercs, this jacket’s interior is lined with protective plates and hard padding.

Medium Trooper. Much like the light variant, this is a suit of layered padding with a chest piece and guards made of tempered polymer plating.

Nanoweave Suit. This variant of the trooper armor has been fortified with a coating made of nanocarbons fused over the protective plate.

| Name            | Cost | Weight | AC  | Strength | Stealth      |
| --------------- | ---- | ------ | --- | -------- | ------------ |
| Reinforced Mesh | 100  | 4      | 12  | -        | -            |
| Military Jacket | 500  | 6      | 13  | 13       | -            |
| Medium Trooper  | 500  | 12     | 14  | -        | Disadvantage |
| Nanoweave Suit  | 7500 | 14     | 15  | -        | Disadvantage |

### Heavy Armor
Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

Guardian. Often made of inexpensive material, this bulky armor is a combination of thick padding, rigid metal plates and mesh weaving. It is popular amongst space miners and bunker sentries.

Heavy Trooper. This is a full suit of reinforced mesh underneath a layer of interlocking plates made from hardened composite. Armored gloves and boots are included as well.

Centurion. A suit of heavy trooper armor outfitted with a tempered multi-alloy chest piece with protective shoulder and leg guards. This armor is often limited to high-ranking soldiers and elite infantry.

Fusion Armor. The best in full body protection, this high-grade armor is made from fused meteoric alloys and bolstered with an additional layer of fullerene polymers.

| Name           | Cost  | Weight | AC  | Strength | Stealth      |
| -------------- | ----- | ------ | --- | -------- | ------------ |
| Guardian Armor | 300   | 55     | 14  |          | Disadvantage |
| Heavy Trooper  | 750   | 15     | 16  | Str 13   | Disadvantage |
| Centurion      | 2000  | 55     | 17  | Str 15   | Disadvantage |
| Fusion Armor   | 15000 | 60     | 118 | Str 16   | Disadvantage |

\pagebreakNum

### Shields
Shields come in multiple designs – curved, cornered, composite, energy, etc. All work along the same function, being worn on the off hand and used manually against incoming attacks. The only exception is the Portable Shield Device which is active at all times.

> A portable shield device (PSD) is often worn by long distance travelers. It has a sorium core and is designed to repel high-velocity weapon fire from weapons using the same technology. It can be tailored to fit any wearable hard surfaced item like a bracer, belt, helmet, or the like. While it provides no bonus to AC, it requires no proficiency to use and counts as wearing armor versus weapons that possess the high-velocity property. It also provides a +2 bonus to Burst saves if worn without armor.
> Without a PSD or any armor, a high-velocity weapon deals an additional die of damage with an increased probability of a critical strike (see Weapon Properties).

| Name                         | Cost | Weight | AC      | Stealth |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ------- | ------- |
| Reinforced                   | 100  | 3      | +2      | -       |
| Portable Shield Device (PSD) | 50   | -      | Special | -       |

# Weapons
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a blade or a pistol, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the Astra Genesis, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.

## Weapon Proficiency
Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, batons, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, polearms, and heavy firearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

## Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

- **Adaptable**. A ranged weapon with this property can be used in close quarters combat without suffering a disadvantage on attack rolls.

- **Ammunition**. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing ammunition from a case or cocking a sidearm are all part of the attack (requiring a free hand for a one-handed weapon). If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in this section).


\pagebreakNum

- **Burst Fire**. A weapon with the burst fire property can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 10-foot cube (4 map grid squares) within the weapon’s normal range. A burst is far more uncontrolled than an aimed shot. A burst fire attack can only be taken once per turn and must be within the weapon’s short range. Any creature within the 10-foot cube must make a Dexterity saving throw versus the Burst save DC or suffer the weapon’s damage. A +2 bonus can be added if a PSD is used without armor. Ability modifiers **cannot** be added to the damage roll for a burst fire attack. A weapon can be fired in burst as many times as the number in parenthesis before requiring a full round for the clip to replenish ammunition. This can also be avoided by using an action or bonus action to change out a clip. Changing a clip requires at least one free hand.

*Burst save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (if proficient) + your Dexterity modifier*

- **Energy Burst**. When a successful attack is made with a weapon with this property, a bonus action can be used to fire a burst of energy from its tip or edge. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have their movement reduced by 10 feet until the end of their next turn.

- **Explosive**. Damage from a weapon with this property counts as both fire damage and the damage type listed. Resistances or immunities apply only if the target has them for both damage types. When a target wearing no armor (or PSD) and with no natural armor takes damage from a weapon with this property, the target takes twice the number of dice in damage on the initial damage roll, but not for subsequent damage caused by the same attack. Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

- **Heavy**. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

- **High-Velocity**. This property allows a weapon to fire high velocity bullets in quick succession from a clip modified with a sorium core. There is no need to replenish ammunition unless depleted through Burst Fire. If a weapon with this property is used to attack a target that is wearing no armor (or PSD) and has no natural armor, the target takes an additional die of damage. In addition, the attack scores a critical hit on a 19-20.

- **Light**. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

- **Power Cell**. A weapon with this property uses a Power cell for its ammunition. Reload on a roll of a 1.

- **Recoil**. This numerical value indicates the minimum strength bonus required to handle a high powered recoil weapon without penalty. If this requirement is not met, you may not add your Dexterity modifier to attack or damage rolls. In addition, if the recoil value is higher than your Strength modifier by 2 or more, you are also at disadvantage to all attack rolls made with the weapon.

- **Reload**. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

- **Special**. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).

- **Stun**. This weapon can be set to stun where it deals no damage, however any target who is hit by this weapon must then make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of their next turn. This is common in Energy Weapons.

- **Thrown**. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a combat knife, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the knife has the finesse property.

- **Two-Handed**. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

- **Versatile**. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Using Recoil and Burst Fire
When a weapon has both the burst fire and recoil properties, the recoil property directly affects the burst fire property when making burst fire attacks. If a creature attacking with a firearm cannot add their Dexterity modifier due to recoil, the attacker also loses their Dexterity bonus when calculating their Burst save DC with that weapon. Similarly, if a creature’s attack with a firearm has disadvantage due to recoil, all targets of a burst fire attack with that weapon would have advantage to their burst saves.

This rule, however, is limited to the effects of recoil only, and is not universal. For example, a creature gaining advantage on a weapon attack with a firearm does not automatically give disadvantage to their target’s burst saves.

\pagebreakNum

### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a crowbar, a brick, or a robot arm.

Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a crowbar is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described here.

**Grenade Launcher**. This weapon allows you to make a ranged weapon attack using your Dexterity to launch a grenade instead of making an Athletics check. You must still be proficient in grenades to add your proficiency modifier to the attack roll. The DC versus your attack roll remains the same as listed on the Grenade Range table. The minimum required range is listed in the Launcher Range column.

**Shotgun**. This weapon fires in a 30 ft. cone at one target. Roll to hit the target and use the rules for Burst Fire for anyone else caught within the radius. Firing at 10 feet will score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

**Sniper Rifle**. Using this weapon requires an attack action and a bonus action. The minimum distance for this weapon is 40 ft. If used at a closer distance, the attacker will suffer a disadvantage to the attack roll. Attacks with this weapon score a critical hit on a 19 or 20. If you use this weapon with a weapon stand or while you are prone, the recoil value is reduced to 1. Using this weapon while prone does not give you disadvantage to your attack rolls due to the condition.

### Grenades
A grenade can be thrown with a successful Strength (Athletics) check. If you are proficient with grenades, add your proficiency bonus to the Strength check. If you are proficient in Athletics and grenades, you add double your proficiency modifier to the Strength check. The Grenade Range table provides the DC required to reach the intended range. If the roll is successful, each target in a 15 foot radius must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking the full damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

If the Strength check made to throw the grenade is unsuccessful, the targets will only take half damage on a failed save and no damage on a successful one. In addition, all targets gain advantage to saves versus the grenades’ effects, if any.

There are five common types of grenades.

- **Fragmentation**. Often nicknamed “frag grenades”, these are the most common type of grenade used in military confrontations. When the grenade explodes, shards of shrapnel are propelled at high velocity within the area.

- **EMP**. Short for “electro-magnetic pulse”, these grenades release a pulse of electricity that targets electronics and powered equipment. These grenades do no damage and have no effect on living targets. All mechanical constructs and automatons must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or be considered Impaired until the end of their next turn (see appendix A). In addition, any unshielded computer panel or electronic device not worn by another creature will cease to function until the start of your next turn.

- **Gas**. These grenades release a toxic gas within its area of effect. In addition to damage, each target that fails their saving throw become poisoned (see appendix A)

- **Phosphorous**. This incendiary grenade produces intense heat through an explosive chemical reaction. Targets who fail their saving throw take an additional 1d8 fire damage at the end of each of their turns. To extinguish the flames, the target must spend an action and make a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. In addition, until the end of your next turn, any creature entering the area of effect suffers 1d6 fire damage. 

- **Stun**. This grenade deals no damage, however any target who fails their Dexterity saving throw versus this grenade must then make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of their next turn.

| 20 ft.         | 60 ft.         | 12  |

### SPECIAL WEAPONS
Weapons with special rules are described below.

**GRENADE LAUNCHER**

Rather than traditional power cells, the grenade launcher fires grenades. When firing a grenade at long range, or if you don't meet the grenade launchers strength requirement, creatures within the radius of the grenades explosion have advantage on the saving throw. If you lack proficiency in the grenade launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.

**ROCKET LAUNCHER**

Rather than traditional power cells, the rocket launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of rockets. When firing a rocket at long range, or if you dont meet the rocket launchers strength requirement, creatures within the radius of the rockets explosion have advantage on the saving throw.

## Gear Descriptions
- Antitoxin. A creature that drinks or is injected with this liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to automatons or constructs.

- Binoculars (Micro). These mini-binoculars extend your visual range. You can see up to a distance of 10 times the range of your normal vision. You cannot see any objects within 15 feet and are at disadvantage to all Wisdom (Perception) checks made to notice anything within 15 feet of you.

- Binoculars (Rangefinding). These are slightly larger and function the same as micro binoculars. These, however, also provide a readout of exact distance between you and a chosen point of focus. You also receive advantage to any Intelligence (Investigation) rolls made when searching for any details regarding your point or object of focus.

- Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a box of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.

- Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

- Climber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes spikes, interlocking hooks, boot tips, mag-gloves, and a climbing harness.

Once triggered, each target in a 15-foot radius of the charge must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Treat this damage as if it were a weapon with the explosive property. The charge can be moved but disarming it requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom check with demolition tools.

- EV suit. This bulky outfit is often used whenever walking into zones deemed to be biohazards. The suit has a built in air filtration unit and is chemically sealed. While wearing this suit, you are immune to poison and disease, however, your movement rate is halved and you cannot take reactions. Lasts 4 hours. (This is also listed in Light Armor)

- Grapple Gun. This item has 50 feet of a strong, thin climbing cable coiled within its base. It can be fired and tethered to a surface with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check and hook onto a solid ledge or against most non- metallic surfaces. When using this device, you ignore any Strength rolls required for climbing checks and have a climbing rate of 30. It can hold up to 2 people without snapping. The cable has 3 hit points and an AC of 9 while extended. If used for anything but climbing, however, skill checks may still be required up to the GM’s discretion.

\pagebreakNum

- Healing Ampoule. A creature that drinks or is injected with this liquid regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering this medical vial takes an action.

- Holo-projector. Linking this item to a SIM Unit or Recording Unit allows you to create three-dimensional recordings within a 10-foot square which include both video and audio.

- Micro Toolset. This small set of tools grants you advantage on any Wisdom (Mechanics) skill checks to repair minor electronic tools and devices such as a SIM Unit or Portable Media Device. This provides no benefit for complex items such as automatons, computers, drones, weapons, or vehicles.

- Motion Sensor. This device is linked to a display screen which presents the device’s data. The device can sense motion through walls and solid surfaces, indicating the location of any moving object within 50 feet.

- Nightvision Goggles. These provide you with the ability to see in dim light and darkness within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and within 60 feet of you as if it were in dim light. You cannot discern color, only shades of gray. While wearing these goggles, you have disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks and Intelligence (Investigation) checks having to do with sight. If you are wearing these goggles in bright light during your turn, you must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to remove them or become blinded until the end of your next turn.

- Pack Attachment. This is a container the size of a backpack that may be attached directly to the back of any suit of medium or heavy armor. Items carried within this container have their weight reduced by half.

## Spell Descriptions

### ADVANCED HAYWIRE
5th-level evocation

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a frayed universal cable)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- Classes: Artificer, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard
You cause machines to undergo catastrophic failure. Choose a point you can see within range. The vehicles, lights, speakers, and wires in a 60-foot cube centered on that point begin to malfunction dangerously until the spell ends.

Vehicles. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a vehicle in the area to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you can cause the vehicle to move up to its movement speed in a straight line, but not outside the cube. On a successful save, the vehicle is unaffected.

Lights. At the end of each of your turns, you can choose one light source in the area. Creatures within 10 feet of the light source that can see it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn.

Speakers. You are aware of all speakers in the spell’s area. At the start of each of your turns, you can choose one speaker or a machine with a speaker, such as a walkie talkie or smartphone, in the cube. Each creature in a 15-foot cone from the speaker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 thunder damage and be deafened for 1 minute.

Wires. Wires tear themselves out of the ground, floor, and walls and begin sparking violently. When a creature moves into or within the area, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 lightning damage for every 5 feet it travels until the start of its next turn.

### ARCANE GRAFFITI
Conjuration cantrip

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: 1 hour
This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or a short message, which can be no larger than 2 feet tall and consist of no more than six words, on a nonliving creature or object. The writing can be visible or invisible. An arcane graffiti spell enables you to etch the words upon any substance (even stone or metal) without harming the material upon which the mark is placed. If invisible graffiti is made, the casting of any spell within 30 feet causes the words to become visible for 5 rounds.

### AWAKEN VEHICLE
6th-level transmutation

- Casting Time: 8 hours
- Range: Touch
- Components: V S M (holy motor oil worth at least 150,000₵, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Cleric, Druid, Bard
After spending the casting time tracing blessed motor oil in magical roadways along the exterior of the vehicle, you touch a huge or smaller vehicle. The vehicle becomes a sentient vehicle, and gains an Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. The vehicle gains senses similar to a human’s.

The awakened vehicle is charmed by you for 30 days or until you and your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened vehicle chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the vehicle can be of any size.

### BOOMERANG SHOT
Cantrip transmutation

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Firearm range
- Components: V M (a ranged weapon)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon against one target within the weapon’s range. If the attack misses the projectile loops around, and you can use your reaction to make the attack again at the same target, ignoring advantage, disadvantage, and cover, and without consuming additional ammunition. If the attack misses a second time, roll your weapon’s damage dice. You take the rolled amount as damage of the weapon’s damage type.

The attack deals an extra 1d8 damage when you reach 5th level (1d8), 11th level (2d8), and 17th level (3d8).

### BURGLAR'S BUDDY
2nd-level illusion (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Self (10-foot radius)
- Components: V, S, M (a camera lens cover)
- Duration: 1 minute
You create a magical area around you, suppressing all mechanical or electronic intrusion alarms and alarms sensors in the area. Burglar alarms or other intrusion alarms within the affected area simply fail to function; sensors for intrusion alarm systems (such as motion detectors, IR detectors, pressure sensors, electric eyes, and so forth) also fail to function, sending no signal to monitoring stations. Video surveillance devices stop sending whatever the image they were photographing the moment when the spell was cast.

\pagebreakNum

### CAMOUFLAGE VEHICLE

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V S M (an unpaid parking ticket)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
- Classes: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Wizard
A vehicle you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Creatures are also invisible while riding the vehicle. While you are within 60 feet of the vehicle, you can speak a command word to end the spell. The spell ends when the vehicle or any creature inside attacks, casts a spell, or takes damage.

### CHAOS SHOT
2nd-level evocation

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Firearm range
- Components: V M (a ranged weapon)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Artificer, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged attack with a weapon against a creature or vehicle within range. If you hit, your ammunition erupts with chaotic magical energy. Roll a d8. The number rolled on the d8 determines the damage type for all attacks made as part of this spell, as shown below.

| D8  | DAMAGE TYPE |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1   | Acid        |
| 2   | Cold        |
| 3   | Fire        |
| 4   | Force       |
| 5   | Lightning   |
| 6   | Poison      |
| 7   | Psychic     |
| 8   | Thunder     |

Additionally, on a hit the shot must redirect itself from the target to a different creature or vehicle of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, which could cause the shot to redirect again, targeting up to a maximum of 5 targets. A target can be targeted only once per turn by these attacks.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, each target of this spell takes an additional 1d8 damage for each slot level above 2nd.

- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You attempt to commandeer a vehicle that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be controlled by you. If it currently has a driver, it has advantage on the saving throw.

 While the vehicle is commandeered, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required). The vehicle becomes sentient and can perform its own actions to obey your commands. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Drive in that direction,” “Run over that creature,” or “Crash into that wall.” If the vehicle completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it does nothing.

A creature at the vehicle’s controls can attempt to wrench control away from you, causing the vehicle to make a new Constitution saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 9th level, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

### CONJURE TURRET
2nd-level conjuration (ritual)

- Casting Time: 1 bonus action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V S M (a shell casing)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
- Classes: Artificer, Cleric, Paladin, Ranger
A tripod mounted weapon appears, fully loaded, and ready for combat. The turret manifests physically on a surface in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. Alternatively you can manifest it on a vehicle that is Large or larger which you can see within range, and which has space for a mounted weapon. Choose one of the following options for what appears.

An assault cannon
A gatling gun
A rocket launcher
This magic weapon can be used normally as a mounted massive weapon, except that it cannot be unmounted, and you can reload it with conjured magical ammunition as a bonus action while you are within 60 feet of it. The ammunition disappears when the spell ends. You are proficient with this weapon. Creatures can move freely through its space.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 force damage when it hits for every two slot levels above the 2nd. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can use your bonus action to attack twice with this weapon using your spellcasting modifier while you are within 60 feet of it.

\pagebreakNum

### CONTRACT
3rd-level enchantment (ritual)

- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: 10 feet
- Components: V S M (a written, typed, or digital contract)
- Duration: Special
- Classes: Artificer, Bard, Warlock, Wizard
When you cast this spell, you bind the souls of two parties to a contract, forcing them to adhere to it or suffer dire penalties. Choose two willing creatures within range. They must verbally agree to the terms of the contract used as the material component for the spell, and must not be suffering from the charmed condition. The contract also has a length which determines the duration of the spell, up to 1 year.

When you cast this spell, choose agony, death, or misfortune as the penalty for violating the contract, which the targeted creatures are aware of before agreeing to the terms. At the DM's discretion, you may choose an alternative effect for violating the contract, but it should be no more powerful than those described below.

Once both creatures have agreed to the contract, the spell takes effect. If either creature is ever in violation of the terms of the contract, down to the letter, it suffers the effects of the chosen penalty. The penalty is in effect until the creature is in accordance with the terms of the contract.

Agony. Every day at dawn, the creature takes 6d6 psychic damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, the creature falls unconscious and is stable.

Death. Every day at dawn, the creature takes 1d6 necrotic damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

Misfortune. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma and Wisdom saving throws. Additionally, when the creature rolls a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you instead treat the roll as if it were a 1.

The spell can be ended early if both creatures verbally agree to end it while within 10 feet of each other, so long as each creature is not suffering from the charmed condition. A remove curse spell also ends this spell if it is cast using a spell slot level equal to or higher than the spell slot used to cast this spell. If the spell is ended early, both creatures are aware of it.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

### DATAREAD
2nd-level divination (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You run your finger over any machine-readable data source (a barcode, a computer disk, a USB drive, or any similar record) to understand the content of the data. You experience the data as it would normally be experienced through an appropriate machine. For example, if reading a USB with music, you hear the music in your head. If reading a word processor file, you visualize and read an image of the page. If reading a barcode, you see the serial number, pricing information, or other barcoded data.

The amount of time required to experience the data is the same as that required to read it by conventional means. You can normally read 2 pages of documents in 1 minute. This spell does not decode encrypted data. Without the encryption code, an encrypted document or file appears as a seemingly random string of characters. If you know the encryption code, however, you can read encrypted data normally with this spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for 10 minutes. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for 1 hour.

### DECOMPOSE
2nd-level necromancy

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V S M (a pinch of grave dirt)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
This spell rapidly causes the body to decay. There are two possible uses for the spell, depending on whether the target is a living or dead creature.

If you cast this spell targeting a living creature, make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 necrotic damage.

If you cast this spell targeting a dead creature, the body rapidly decays, increasing the amount of time the creature has been dead by 10 days for the purposes of the time limit on raising the target from the dead. For example, a dead creature targeted by this spell could not be returned to life by the raise dead spell.


 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell targeting a living creature using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

> DM TIP: STAYING DEAD
In a cyberpunk world that has high amounts of magic, it may be difficult for the player characters to keep a creature dead. After all, if resurrection magic exists, a corporation would undoubtedly have the resources to pay for it, and the wealthy could have death insurance contracts that include attempts to raise the contract holder from the dead. What are are the player characters to do? There are numerous options, including dissolving it in acid, or burning it to ashes. However, with the resurrection spell, a VIP could still be returned to life, though at great expense. The player characters could also use the decompose spell to rapidly age the body out of easy raising, or make it completely impossible to resurrect with higher levels of the spell.



### DEGAUSS
1st-level transmutation (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous
By touching a single device that contains electronic files, such as a computer, external hard drive, USB flash drive, or magnetic disk, you erase all files on that device. The device is rendered empty of data.

## ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE
3rd-level evocation (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous
When you cast this spell, you send a powerful burst of energy that ruins electronic circuitry in a 20-foot cube. Any computer, telephone, television, or other device with a computer processor inside ceases to function immediately, and the contents of hard drives and other storage media are scrambled.

The electromagnetic pulse affects only devices with extensive circuitry, not everything that uses electricity. Ordinarily the lights stay on, although their electronic switches might not function. Automobiles continue to run, although their engines will run more roughly without electronic guidance. Cars with an electronic ignition system won't start after the spell.

Devices affected by this spell can be fixed using an engineering kit.

### FIND RIDE
2nd-level conjuration

- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V S
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Paladin
You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a sentient motorcycle, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the motorcycle can move and act independently. It has the statistics of a motorcycle, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a construct. Additionally, the motorcycle’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma become 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak. The vehicle has senses similar to a human’s.

Your motorcycle serves you as a vehicle, both in and out of combat, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. You are considered proficient with land vehicles while driving your summoned motorcycle, if you were not already. While driving your motorcycle, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your motorcycle.

When the motorcycle drops to 0 hit points, it explodes, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your motorcycle at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same motorcycle, restored to its hit point maximum.

While your motorcycle is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.

You can't have more than one motorcycle bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the motorcycle from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can summon a sports motorcycle. If you use a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can summon a warcycle with a flying speed of 140 feet.

### FIND THE ROAD
4th-level transmutation

- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: Touch
- Components: V S M (a bit of road tar)
- Duration: 8 hours
- Classes: Druid, Ranger
Touch one land vehicle. For the duration, as the vehicle travels, a magical paved road emerges from the ground or water, pushing aside natural terrain, as well as trees under 5 feet in width.


 The shape of the terrain is not altered, so rock walls, cliffs, and mountains are unaffected. After the vehicle passes, the road vanishes behind it, and the terrain regains its original form.

The vehicle can travel no faster than a rate of 80 feet per round in combat or 40 miles per hour out of combat on this road.

### HAYWIRE
Transmutation cantrip (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a small magnet)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This cantrip causes a single device to behave randomly and erratically, defying any attempts to bring it under control. Cash registers display random prices and open their money drawers repeatedly. Escalators surge forward, then reverse themselves. Automatic teller machines flash random patrons' account balances on the screen as they spew forth receipts (not money, though).

It's impossible to describe the exact effects of haywire on every modern device. In general, a machine subject to haywire functions as if someone were pressing random buttons or otherwise manipulating it randomly.

Turning off a device subject to a haywire spell doesn't work, because the spell disables the “off” switch. Cutting off the power supply (by unplugging it, for example) disables the device 1d4 rounds later, ending the spell.

This cantrip doesn't disable the devices (for example, a camera might get a static effect but it will continue recording, and a door with an electronic lock might not be openable while is under the effects of this cantrip)

### INSTANT CONNECTIVITY
5th-level conjuration (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 10 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a device connected to internet worth at least 100)
- Duration: Instantaneous
With the aid of instant messaging software, you physically transport the subject or subjects from one place to another. If several willing creatures link hands in a circle, up to eight creatures can be affected by the spell at the same time.

At least one of the creatures affected must be touching a computer with Internet connection. The targets must be sent to a specific computer that is currently active online. Instant connectivity causes the targets to appear in the room from which the receiving device is, automatically gaining surprise on anyone else in that room.

You must have seen the receiving device for at least 1 minute from 5 feet or less to be able to target that device.

If any of the devices have some kind of security (or if the device is in a secure network), the spell cannot be casted until the security is disabled (for more information about disabling security, read the "Using Electronic Devices" section).

### JAM SIGNALS

# New Astra Genesis Rules
These rules typically only apply to outside of tactical combat which uses fairly standard 5e rules. This is written from a GM perspective but anyone can read it to know how these systems work.

## Heroism
Heroism is a currency in the Astra Genesis game. Each session you begin with Zero Heorism. You are encouraged to use them because you will lose them. You can earn them from action in a session but at the end of the session they are all lost. Whenever a character attempts a Task and scores a greater number of successes than the Difficulty, then these excess successes become Heroism, a valuable resource that allows characters to complete the Task more quickly or more thoroughly than normal, or otherwise gain additional benefits. Each success above and beyond the Difficulty of a Task becomes one point of Heorism, which the character may use immediately, may save for later, or some mixture of the two.

### Spending Heroism
The normal use for Heroism is to improve the outcome of a successful Task, such as gaining more information from research, inflicting more damage with an attack, or making more progress with an ongoing problem.

Immediately after determining if a Task is successful, the GM will describe the basic outcome of that Task. Heroism may then be spent to improve this outcome, or provide other benefits. Heroism used in this way doesn’t need to be declared in advance, and each point can be spent one at a time as required. For example, a character may see how much damage an attack has inflicted before spending Heroism to inflict more. Thus, Heroism can’t be wasted by being used on something that wasn’t necessary.

Most uses for Heroism can only be used once on any given Task, or once in any given Round in combat. Some Heroism spends are noted as being repeatable, which means that they can be used as frequently as the character wishes and as the Heroism available to spend on them. Once the character’s Task has been resolved, any unspent Heroism is added to the their pool; Heroism that cannot be added to the their pool is lost if it isn’t spent.

- **CREATE OPPORTUNITY(Repeatable, varies)**. You can buy additional d20s for checks/tasks at the cost of Heroism but no more than 3 this way
  - 1st d20: 1 Heorism
  - 2nd d20: 2 Heorism
  - 3rd d20: 3 Heroism
- **OBTAIN INFORMATION (Repeatable, 1)**. Heroism from a successful Task allows a character to learn more about a situation. Each point of Heroism spent can be used to ask the Gamemaster a single question about the current situation, or an item, object, structure, creature, or character present in or relevant to the scene at hand. The Gamemaster must answer this question truthfully, but the Gamemaster does not have to give complete information — a partial or brief answer that leaves room for further questions is more common. The information provided must be relevant to the Task attempted, and it must be the kind of information that a character using that skill would be able to determine in that situation — a character could use Observational to diagnose an illness, or Mental to identify a form of ranged weapon from the damage it causes.
- **INVOKE VALUE(3)**. You can spend **3 Heroism** to invoke a value and gain a d20. When doing it this way you are considered to have already rolled a success.
- **CREATE AN ADVANTAGE(2)** Heroism can allow a character to produce a positive or advantageous circumstance. Spending **two Heroism** establishes some new Advantage in addition to whatever effect the successful Task had. Advantages created must relate to the nature of the Task attempted, and it must be something that could logically result from the character’s actions. This may instead be used to remove a Complication currently in play, or to create a Complication on an adversary. This can be as simple as "We brought rope in our packs to cross the Ravine (a complication), or in combat (even 5e combat) it can give you the 5e definition of Advantage (a re-roll take the highest) or counter Disadvantage making the roll straight.

### Earning Heorism
- PC's start with 2
- Rolling more successes than you need on skill checks
- You can buy Heroism for Threat.

## Invoking a Value
Whenever you’re making a skill roll, and you’re in a situation where an value might be able to help you, you can spend a Heroism point to invoke it in order to change the dice result. This allows you to add 1d6 to your roll. You can do this before or after you’ve rolled the dice—if you aren’t happy with your total.

You also have to explain or justify how the value is helpful in order to get the bonus—sometimes it’ll be self-evident, and sometimes it might require some creative narrating.

You can spend multiple heorism on a roll to get an extra 1d6 for each point spent on the roll.

## Traits/Advantages/Complications
Traits, Advantages, and Complications form a system that assists you while framing a scene, by highlighting the circumstances that may affect characters, benefit them, and also hinder their actions. Traits can do a number of things and a good mix is vital to establishing a scene that characters can navigate effectively.

### Traits

Traits that aren’t inherently advantageous or complicate the scene have the potential to do both, depending on the characters present and the Tasks they want to attempt. Traits will either present the characters with an Advantage, present them with a Complication, or not affect the scene in this circumstance. As Gamemaster, you have the final say in whether they affect the Task or not.

Traits can last for a number of scenes, Rounds or even over several game sessions and their impact may have lasting impact on the characters. They can be introduced either when you are framing a scene (establishing its circumstances and therefore its Traits), through spending 2 Threat points when a scene or encounter is already in play, or by a character through spending Heroism or Threat. Traits should last for as long as they are applicable, but don’t necessarily change or go away just because the story moves away from a location and come back later — a planet’s atmosphere doesn’t change much in the lifespans of most species, so a Trait linked to a planet’s atmosphere will appear as many times as the Player Characters are there.

Traits are broken up into several types, denoting where they show up. Situation Traits tend to only be temporary, while location Traits will come up every time the Players visit that place, and a personal or species Trait reflects a certain character, particularly Non-Player Characters. These types should tell you in what circumstances they come up. Location Traits may affect all Tasks in the area, while character Traits will only affect certain interactions with one character.

Particularly potent Traits may be indicated by a number after them. A “Hazardous Atmosphere 2” Trait will mean it increases Difficulties by 2 rather than just 1 and may even make most Tasks impossible to accomplish without an appropriate Advantage. It essentially counts as two identical Traits, rather than one.

### Advantages
Advantages are Traits that are inherently advantageous to characters and will only ever provide a benefit. Advantages come about mostly from equipment, Heroism spends, or Threat spends in the case of NPCs. They reduce difficulties for characters attempting Tasks the Advantage relates to or make that Task possible where it normally wouldn’t have been. Advantages can be shared, as either a new location or situation Trait, or can be personal to a character as a Character Trait. Remember you can always spend Threat just as Players spend Heroism, creating Advantages for your NPCs during a scene or encounter. Advantages can never be used as a Complication, against a character — they are only helpful.

### Complications
Complications are Traits that get in the way or complicate a character’s Tasks. They either increase a Task’s difficulty or make it impossible where normally it would have been possible. Complications allow for creative additions or changes to your scenes and is the type of Trait the Gamemaster has most agency over during play. For example, an engineer might succeed in their task but blow out some power relays, blocking them off from their crewmates. In essence, this creates a new obstacle for the Player Characters. Combined with incoming enemies, it could make for an interesting encounter. Alternatively, it could be saved for later. But Complications aren’t as powerful as spending a lot of Threat, and Players should be able to overcome those setbacks with a Task or a short Challenge.

You can also increase the Complication range of a Task, given the circumstances of the scene or the Task. By increasing the Complication range you give more possibility to a Complication arising, letting you either bank two Threat or create a Complication for that Player Character.

## Threat
Threat provides a unique mechanic to raise the stakes of the scene, encounter, or even the entire mission. It allows you to increase the Difficulty, provide Complications, and change the scene in your favor.

The Gamemaster begins every session with two Threat for each Player at the table. This allows you to have a pool of Threat available at the beginning of the game, but you will also gain Threat in the following ways:

**Immediate Heroism**: Whenever the character uses an Immediate Heroism Spend — such as to buy bonus d20s — they normally choose to pay that cost in Heroism from the group’s pool. However, the character may instead choose to pay some or all that cost by adding one point of Threat to the pool for each point of Heroism that would otherwise have been spent.

**Complications**: When a character suffers one or more Complications on a Task, they or the Gamemaster may choose not to have the Complication take effect, in exchange for adding two to the Threat pool.

\pagebreakNum

**Threatening Circumstances**: The environment or circumstances of a new scene may be threatening enough to warrant adding one or two Threat to the pool automatically. Similarly, some Non-Player Characters — this will be listed in their rules — may generate Threat just for turning up, in response to circumstances, or by taking certain actions. This also includes activities that escalate the tensions of the scene, such as Player Characters using deadly force. If it has Legendary Actions - it causes threat for each Legendary Action Point.

**Non-Player Character Heroism**: Non-Player Characters with unspent Heroism cannot save it as Player characters can — Non-Player Characters don’t have a group Heroism pool. Instead, a Non- Player Character can spend Heroism to add to Threat, adding one Threat for each Heroism spent (Repeatable).

When you are framing a scene, it is up to you which Traits you establish affecting how the Player Characters will interact with the scene. Once the scene is underway, the only way to change those circumstances is the use of Threat, or through the actions of Non-Player Characters.

**This is very important: any change the Gamemaster wishes to make to circumstances once a scene has begun must come from either a Non-Player Character or from spending Threat.**

You could bring in reinforcements during an encounter, or increase the difficulty of curing a virus, but Threat really comes into its own when used as a creative tool to completely change the circumstances the Player Characters find themselves in. From plot twists to unexpected events, Threat can be used to create a shift in the dramatic conflict. You could spend that five Threat to bring in five more Orc warriors, but what if, instead, the klaxons on board suddenly sounded “Self-destruct sequence initiated, silent countdown begun...” The encounter has changed completely and the Player Characters need to decide how to act next.

Threat also relies on an economy with the Players at the table, as well as the Threat your Non-Player Characters generate through their own ‘Heroism’. Remember that Players can always pay for their Create Opportunity Heroism spend with Threat. You may also wish to bank two Threat instead of implementing a Complication from a Player’s dice roll.

It’s especially effective when the way the Gamemaster spends Threat has a clear tie to the way Threat was generated in a scene. If the scene says there’s an alarm panel, then a Non-Player Character activating that panel may add to Threat, and then that Threat can naturally be used to bring in reinforcements, creating a sense of cause and effect. This approach can be helpful for making Threat seem like a natural part of the process, rather than something abrupt or intrusive.

### Threat Spends
**Non-Player Character Heroism**. The Threat pool serves as a mirror for the Players’ group Heroism pool. Thus, Non-Player Characters may use Threat in all the ways that Player Characters use group Heroism.

**Non-Player Character Threat Spends**. For any action or choice where a Player Character would add one or more points to Threat, a Non-Player Character performing that same action or choice must spend the equivalent number of points of Threat.

**Non-Player Character Complications**. If a Non-Player Character suffers a Complication, the Gamemaster may prevent the Complication by spending two Threat.

**Complication**. The Gamemaster may create a Complication by spending two Threat.

**Reinforcements**. The Gamemaster may bring in additional Non-Player Characters during a scene. Minor Non-Player Characters cost one Threat apiece, while Notables cost two. Starship reinforcements cost Threat equal to their Scale.

**Environmental Effects**. The Gamemaster may trigger or cause problems with the environment by spending Threat.

**Reversal**. The Gamemaster may end a scene or encounter prematurely, with the situation unresolved, by spending two Threat for each Player Character present in that scene or encounter. The Gamemaster describes the manner in which the situation escalates or deteriorates in a major way — such as large numbers of enemy reinforcements, or some other imminent catastrophe — and then ends the scene. This cannot be used to harm or kill the player characters directly, only to radically change their circumstances, and the Players should be given a few moments to discuss their new situation before the Gamemaster sets a new scene (either with those characters, or, to raise the tension, with other characters elsewhere).

## Values
Values form the fundamental aspect of a character’s beliefs and personality. They define who the Player Characters are and how they react in any given situation. While Players can use Heroism to **invoke** these values for an automatic success, it gives them a framework to roleplay by, you as the Gamemaster can use those Values against a Player Character, giving them the option of accepting a Complication.

Citing a Value to develop a Complication for a Player uses the character’s beliefs against them to develop drama and a mechanical disadvantage within the mission. If a character Value would ever mean that the character would not act as the Player intends or if it brings up dramatic conflict because of the circumstances, then present the Player with a decision:

The Player Character can either:
- Accept a Complication about their Value and receive 2 points of Heroism
- Decline the Complication granting the Gamemaster 2 Threat

If the Player accepts the Complication, then it could change the scene in one of the following ways: 

\pagebreakNum

Increase the difficulty of Tasks relating to that Complication or make certain Tasks impossible. In this instance, a Complication may take the form of prohibiting a certain course of action. Complications relating to Values are always personal and don’t affect other characters. This could mean that the Player Character finds it more difficult to attempt Tasks relating to that Value or simply won’t attempt them at all.

Players should always should be aware of the consequences of accepting it: they should know the nature of the Complication they’re accepting before they choose to accept it. It is important that Players feel a sense of agency — being able to control their character’s actions — and inhibiting them from certain actions may halt the game. Ultimately, Complications of this nature should add drama to a scene or encounter and shouldn’t unnecessarily stop Players from acting as they wish.

Players may wish to challenge the Value that caused them Complications, based on what happened on the mission in which it was invoked against them, which should be encouraged as it lets their character grow and develop, adapting to their circumstances and experiences. This ties directly to a primary tenet of roleplaying, that the people of the setting are dedicated to lifelong learning, discovery, and self-improvement.

### Directives
Directives are a great way to introduce mission specific Values to your game. One Directive is always in play, the Prime Directive, where “No interference with the social development of said planet...” is paramount to all other mission considerations. While this Directive is always in play, it is sometimes worth highlighting to characters before they engage in their mission or certain actions. Other Directives may come into play based on the mission or at your discretion. 

Players have access to all of these Directives at any time, and can call upon them to use Determination and even challenge them to gain points of Determination. The repercussions of challenging them would be up to you at the end of the mission. Equally, you may use any Directive to introduce a Complication for the characters, persuading them to act in a certain way depending on Alliance’s wishes.

Directives are for you to set, or may be present in pre-written mission supplements, and should reflect the ethos of the mission or the orders given by Alliance Command. Those Directives could remain for one mission, or could form a continuing yard stick by which the crew measures how they act during their on-going missions out on the Final Frontier.


## Extended Tests
Extended Tasks provide a greater challenge for the Player Characters than normal Tasks. While Tasks represent attempting to resolve a problem with one approach and in a short amount of time, Extended Tasks give the Gamemaster the opportunity to present problems that require a longer amount of time and greater degree of work to resolve while there is pressure on the characters to achieve the Task. They can be Tasks that last a whole game session, or even extend over several sessions, and often provide slow mounting tension or much more active problem solving from the Players around the table.

Extended Tasks should only be introduced where there is a definitive pressure on the Player Characters to achieve the Task; that ultimately provides excitement and drama. The following suggestions can provide a pacing mechanism rather than a measure of difficulty — they make the Extended Task longer to complete and the tension should increase because there is some peril or problem that worsens the longer they take.

Consequences: The Extended Task itself is risky, with potential consequences either for failed Tasks, or for Complications that occur during attempted Tasks. These consequences may involve damage, or other lingering problems that make it unwise to make too many attempts.

Limited Attempts: The Extended Task can only be attempted a set number of times, normally equal to the Magnitude, or one lower than the Magnitude, depending on how problematic the Extended Task is meant to be (less is more problematic). If the number of attempts are used up without the Extended Task being completed, then the characters suffer some manner of consequence.

Peril: The Extended Task takes place amongst some persistent peril or hazard. This might be a constantly- hostile environment (such as a barely-breathable atmosphere, extreme temperatures, or some other environment that will have a constant effect), or an environment that presents a risk (such as being on the hull of the ship wearing an environment suit, where a suit breach or being knocked away could prove disastrous). If there’s a constant peril, the characters suffer a small amount of damage or a Complication with each attempted Task (see Damage, Injury, and Recovery, later), making it dangerous to spend too long attempting the Task. If there’s a risky environment, each attempted Task adds one point to Threat, which the Gamemaster may spend to turn that potential for risk into actual danger.

\pagebreakNum

Time Pressure: The Extended Task must be completed within a set amount of time, and exceeding this time limit either makes it impossible to progress or results in some severe consequence. At the start of the Extended Task, the Gamemaster determines the number of Intervals that the Extended Task must be completed within, and how long a period that each Interval represents (ten minutes, an hour, a day, etc.). The ideal number of Intervals is about 2-3 times the Extended Task’s Magnitude, with a smaller number of Intervals resulting in more time pressure on the characters. The Gamemaster should also determine what happens when Time runs out — this should be a severe consequence. Each Task attempted takes two Intervals, though this can be reduced to one by spending two Heroism on a successful Task, and/or increased by one for each Complication suffered (instead of the Complications’ normal effects).

Extended Tasks have several considerations when framing them for Players. You should build your Extended Tasks with the following in mind, and be cautious about when to implement them.

### WORK
The Work Track of an Extended Task is a number from five to twenty, which Players progress along depending on the totals scored on Challenge Dice. Progress can be an indication of how much time is required to resolve the Extended Task or how complex the problem is, but care is required when framing this within a mission. If the Extended Task is not of much importance for the ongoing story, but is required in the session, then consider giving it a low Work Track value, between five and ten. Only Extended Tasks that provide genuine tension to Player’s engagement with the plot of the mission, or are imperative to resolve the conflict at hand, should be given longer Work Tracks.

There is a danger that longer Extended Tasks could become tedious, as a lot of smaller Tasks and Challenge Dice rolls are required to resolve them, particularly if luck is not on the Players’ side. You should always keep in mind the dramatic situation at hand, narrating how progress is being made, rather than relying on the dice and the mechanics to tell the story. How does one success differ from another? How does the character’s approach or Discipline being used inform the progress? Are there any specific approaches that should be especially effective, giving the character extra benefits for Effects rolled on their ?

### MAGNITUDE
The Magnitude of an Extended Task represents how large and complex the Task is, and also provides the Players with the number of Breakthroughs they require. Magnitudes of one or two should be used when a problem or project isn’t very complex or outside the normal remit for the characters. Greater Magnitudes of three to five represent very complex problems or situations with newly discovered phenomena or unusual circumstances. Like the difficulty of normal Tasks, environmental factors or adverse situations may increase the Magnitude by one or two steps, but the Gamemaster should be careful making increases, as repeated Tasks at a difficulty at 3 or more will drain Players’ resources or give you Threat based on their choices. Difficulty can always be increased or reduced through Advantages or Complications.

### BREAKTHROUGHS
A Breakthrough represents success in an Extended Task, a point in the scene or encounter where the Player characters both make some progress toward resolving the problem and gain some insight into its nature. Breakthroughs will occur when the Players roll well, when their characters do good work on the problem at hand, or at the end of the Work track when a lot of work has already been done. Breakthroughs early on could be eureka moments, maybe providing the Player characters with some insight into what actions are having the most effect. In a mechanical sense, it reduces the difficulty by 1. A Breakthrough may also award them additional Heroism in future Tasks relating to this Extended Task or give them a better idea of which Disciplines would be more appropriate or useful. Breakthroughs when the Work track is full come from a lot of work already being done on solving the problem at hand and so the results ride on the progress already carried out.

Every 5 Work = 1 Breakthrough

### RESISTANCE
Resistance should be reserved for the most arduous of Extended Tasks, where obstacles have been placed in the way of the characters by opposing forces, or where environmental factors make progress particularly difficult. Resistance will make the Extended Task longer, so only use it where necessary to the dramatic tension, or as the actions of the Non-Player Characters or situation make things more difficult. Heroism spent by the Players can reduce this value; this can be made sense of dramatically by the characters finding a way around the difficult factor or succeeding at their Task in such a way that it mitigates the obstruction of their attempts.

\pagebreakNum

### COMPLICATIONS
When Complications come up in Extended Tasks, they have ramifications for the Work or Resistance of the Task. Narratively this could come down to a number of reasons, such as technology overloading or breaking down due to adaptation, gaffes in political situations, or biology or naturally occurring phenomena adapting to the characters’ actions. Complications from Extended Tasks don’t usually carry over into the story as a whole unless absolutely appropriate.

### PERIL AND TIME
It may be that the Extended Task occurs without constraints on time or without an imminent danger, but, while framing the Extended Task, the Gamemaster should consider the situation around the Task. It may be that the Players only have a certain amount of time to complete their attempts to resolve the problem; meaning limited attempts should be placed on the Players’ Tasks, related to the Magnitude. Or the Extended Task may be attempted around an immediate peril or during conflict, in which case the Magnitude may be greater or characters may take damage from attempts or Complications. Framing an Extended Task within a perilous scene or encounter will build the tension and make the Tasks exciting for the Players.


An Extended Task also has a base Difficulty, which is used for all Tasks made to overcome the Extended Task. This base Difficulty can be modified on each Task as circumstances (such as Traits) dictate, but they all start from the same place.

Whenever a character succeeds at a Task to overcome an Extended Task, there are a few additional steps to follow over and above the normal procedure for completing a Task.

The character rolls 2d2, plus additional d2 equal to the Discipline used for that Task. The total rolled on these dice is the amount of Work done.

A. If five or more Work is made, after reduction for Resistance, the character also achieves a Breakthrough.

B. If the Work track is filled, or if one or more Work is made after reduction for Resistance, when the Work track was already full, the character achieves a Breakthrough.

If the number of Breakthroughs achieved is equal to the Extended Task’s Magnitude, the Extended Task is complete. Otherwise, the base Difficulty of the Extended Task is reduced by one for each Breakthrough achieved, to a minimum of 0. If the base Difficulty has already been reduced to 0, each subsequent Breakthrough adds +1d2 to any future rolls for Work on this Extended Task.

- Work Force: 5-20
- Magnitude: 1-5
- Difficulty: 5-25
- Resistance: 0-3
- Test: The skill test required
- Interval: How long each test takes

The testing character makes their test if they are successful they roll Xd2 where X is the number of ranks in the relevant skill. Total the D2 (called challenge dice) together and subtract the resistance if there is any. Anything left over is applied directly to the Work Force. For every 5 work force applied; you get 1 Progress. When the Progress equals the Magnitude the test is successful. These should be used somewhat sparingly but they can add drama to certain scenes. Resistance represents difficulties like working under stress, lack of proper tools etc.

## Difficulty
Astra Genesis has a default TN of 18.

Some things may make things easier or harder such as threat. But what defines difficulty is the number of successes needed. This ranges from 1-5 typically. Though some extreme challenges may have 6 or more

## Rolling a 1
Is not a failure in itself but you do get a complication. If you add all your modifiers you may still get a success it will just cost you.

## Rolling a 20
Gives you 2 successes.

> In the beginning ...
> Those words are how the book of Genesis began and I cannot help but ponder them these days. Today is the first day the Armstrong colony exists, with the failure on Mars people are watching us closely. My grandfather died in 2012, 39 years ago and this colony is named in his namesake. I looked out this morning at the slightly blue tinged dome surrounding the operations center and I was struck by how small it all looked against the gray background of the moon surface. In that moment I felt more alone than I ever had, I was supposed to feel pride, honor, and joy at our accomplishment instead I just feel empty like this is it. How do I tell the people up here with me that their great leader now has no idea how to lead a colony. I am not a colonist, I am a naval officer.

## The Breach
Not much is known about The Breach.

It happened 66 years ago, it was catastrophic. It pulled entire worlds from other planes of existence into our own and into our galaxy as well as ships. Earth does know they were doing an experiment on a theorized form of travel where the ship neters another space time but that is really all that is known.

Each colony in the galaxy is either ruled by a government or a Megacorp. There are threats everywhere and Starstriders as sought to do the work no one can accpept. There is no "push for peacful exploration" like we thought of in television shows; instead it is the push to survive in a harsh galaxy where everyone care about what they can get
and the only law in the Rim (unowned space) is what you can enforce yourself.

## The Visitors
While the Breach was open for five years. Many worlds like Corellon and Avandra were pulled from other planes of existence to their similar locations in our Galaxy, with the worlds that were here going to their planes. It is expected to have been a Multiversal Catastrophic event of unknown size.

From this event Orcs, Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Goblins, and numerous other races were found to have arrived. (Including the Sovreki world of Arkenhold which is under Syndicate control).

## The Planetary Alliance

### The Planetary Alliance: An Overview

The Planetary Alliance stands as a beacon of unity and cooperation in the vastness of space, embodying the ideals of peace, exploration, and mutual assistance among its member worlds. The Planetary Alliance is a testament to what diverse species can achieve when they come together for a common purpose.

#### Purpose and Activities

The primary objective of the Planetary Alliance is to foster peaceful coexistence, facilitate scientific and cultural exchanges, and ensure collective security against external threats. It operates as an umbrella organization where member planets collaborate on various fronts including but not limited to space exploration, defense, technology research, environmental preservation, and emergency response across the galaxy.

#### Government Structure

The governing body of the Planetary Alliance is the Assembly, a democratic forum where representatives from each member world convene to discuss policies, address interstellar concerns, and pass resolutions that benefit the collective. The Assembly operates under the principles of equal representation, ensuring that the voice of each member world, regardless of its size or power, is heard and considered.

Leading the Assembly is the Council, composed of elected officials from member worlds, responsible for the day-to-day administration and implementation of Alliance policies. The Council is chaired by the President of the Planetary Alliance, who is elected by the Assembly for a fixed term and acts as the Alliance's spokesperson and executive officer.

#### Interactions Among Members

Member worlds of the Planetary Alliance retain their sovereignty but agree to abide by a charter that promotes shared values and commitments. This includes respecting the territorial integrity of fellow members, providing aid in times of crisis, and refraining from actions that would harm other members or the Alliance as a whole.

Diplomatic missions and embassies facilitate constant communication and negotiation between member worlds, ensuring smooth interactions and cooperation. Joint task forces and collaborative projects are common, highlighting the Alliance's commitment to working together to overcome challenges.

#### Defense and Security

The Planetary Alliance maintains a unified defense force, composed of contributions from member worlds, to protect against external threats and maintain peace within Alliance space. This force operates under the command of the Alliance Security Council, which plans defensive strategies, conducts peacekeeping missions, and responds to emergencies.

#### ADF Structure

##### Alliance navy

## Corpos

> Your briefing on Corpos. They are a real piece of work but essential to the flow of medicine and goods in Alliance Space.

### Background and Structure

The Corpos are conglomerates of various mega-corporations, each a behemoth in its sector, ranging from interstellar travel and logistics to advanced biotech, mining, and terraforming. These corporations have evolved far beyond their initial commercial endeavors to assume roles traditionally held by governmental bodies, controlling entire colonies and systems with a blend of economic prowess and administrative governance.

Their structure is a complex web of subsidiaries, partnerships, and alliances, overseen by a central council of CEOs and corporate magnates. This council coordinates the overarching strategies of the Corpos, ensuring that their collective interests are aligned and that their grip on their domains remains unchallenged.

### Governance and Economy

The Corpos govern their territories through a model that blurs the lines between corporate management and state governance. Each colony or system under their control operates much like a corporate subsidiary, with appointed executives overseeing day-to-day operations, resource allocation, and law enforcement, all tailored to maximize efficiency and profitability.

Their economies are powerhouse engines of innovation and exploitation, driven by relentless pursuit of growth and shareholder value. This has led to advancements in technology, space exploration, and artificial intelligence, albeit often at the cost of societal disparities and environmental degradation.

### Relationship with the Planetary Alliance

As a member of the Planetary Alliance, the Corpos occupy a contentious but indispensable position. Their vast resources, technological capabilities, and control over critical space routes make them a powerful ally in the Alliance's efforts to maintain peace and prosperity across the galaxy. However, their unabashed profit motive and the ethical compromises that often accompany their corporate policies put them at odds with the Alliance's more altruistic goals.

The Corpos advocate for deregulation, free trade, and corporate sovereignty within the Alliance, leveraging their economic might to influence policy decisions. Their membership in the Alliance is a delicate balance of power, with the Corpos often pushing the boundaries of the Alliance's principles to advance their interests while still contributing to the collective security and economic stability of the galaxy.

### Culture and Society

Society within the Corpos' domains is highly stratified, with a clear divide between the corporate elite and the working classes. The former enjoy unparalleled wealth, access to advanced medical treatments, and luxurious lifestyles, often residing in opulent orbital habitats or secluded planetary enclaves. The latter, however, face a harsher reality, with many living in densely populated mega-cities or remote mining colonies, their lives dictated by the demands of corporate employment and consumerism.

Despite these disparities, the allure of innovation, opportunity, and the promise of ascending the corporate ladder draws countless individuals to the Corpos' territories, making them vibrant centers of cultural diversity and social dynamism.

### Conclusion

The Corpos represent the double-edged sword of corporate dominion in space: a testament to human ingenuity and ambition, yet a cautionary tale of power unchecked by the moral and ethical considerations that bind civilized societies. As they navigate their role within the Planetary Alliance and the wider galaxy, the Corpos continue to be a defining force in shaping the future of interstellar civilization.

## Elven Star Republic

Nestled among the stars, the Elven Star Republic stands as a beacon of harmony, wisdom, and tranquility. Drawing inspiration from the enigmatic elves of Dungeons and Dragons lore, this stellar nation combines the grace and affinity for nature characteristic of its people with the expansive possibilities of the cosmos. As a founding signatory of the Planetary Alliance, the Elven Star Republic brings its long-standing traditions of peaceful coexistence and environmental stewardship to the galactic stage.

### Government and Society

The Elven Star Republic is a representative republic, where the sanctity of the natural world is intertwined with the principles of governance. Leadership is chosen through democratic means, with representatives elected from among the various elven communities spread across their star systems. These leaders convene in the Great Council, a governing body that meets within the Arboreal Sanctum, a magnificent space station that orbits their home world, seamlessly blending advanced technology with living ecosystems.

Elven society is marked by its dedication to the arts, scholarly pursuits, and a deep spiritual connection to the universe. Education and knowledge are highly valued, with academies and libraries considered sacred temples of learning. The elves' longevity allows them to accumulate vast knowledge and wisdom, which they generously share with allied species and members of the Planetary Alliance.

\pagebreakNum

## The Syndicate

In the vast expanse of the galaxy, where civilizations rise and fall under the banner of progress and unity, there exists an entity that thrives in the crevices of law and order: The Syndicate. Born from the underbelly of interstellar society, The Syndicate is a formidable coalition of criminals, outlaws, and rogue traders, masterfully orchestrating their operations from the shadows. Utilizing the intricate network established since its secretive formation in 2134, The Syndicate has grown into a pervasive force, challenging the boundaries of legality and morality across the stars.

\pagebreakNum

### Formation and Expansion

The origins of The Syndicate trace back to the tumultuous era following the establishment of the Planetary Alliance, a time when the galaxy buzzed with newfound unity but also teemed with overlooked fringes ripe for exploitation. Sensing an opportunity, a conclave of the galaxy's most cunning criminal minds converged under a common banner, laying the foundation of what would soon become a galactic syndicate of organized crime. Initially operating within the shadowed lanes of trade routes and the less patrolled sectors, The Syndicate quickly expanded its influence, weaving its tendrils through the fabric of both fledgling and established civilizations.

### Structure and Operations

The Syndicate's structure is as elusive as the organization itself, with a hierarchy that prizes anonymity and flexibility. At its apex sits the Shadow Council, a mysterious cadre of leaders whose identities remain obscured even to most within the organization. Beneath them, the organization branches into various cells and factions, each specializing in different aspects of criminal enterprise, from smuggling and black market trade to extortion, espionage, and beyond.

Key to The Syndicate's success is its ability to adapt and thrive in the ever-changing galactic landscape. They employ a mix of traditional underworld tactics and cutting-edge technology, often pilfered or developed through illicit means, to stay one step ahead of law enforcement and rival factions. Their operations are meticulously planned, with a penchant for exploiting loopholes in planetary jurisdictions and alliance treaties, making them a persistent thorn in the side of the Planetary Alliance.

### Influence and Territory

The Syndicate's influence extends across a wide expanse of the galaxy, with notable strongholds in sectors where governance is weak or corruption is ripe. One of their most infamous bases of operations is Cydonia, a world shrouded in secrecy and rumored to house The Syndicate's central command. From such strongholds, they orchestrate a galaxy-wide network of crime and corruption, with every operation meticulously designed to expand their power and wealth.

Despite their criminal nature, The Syndicate has, on occasion, been a necessary evil. Their intricate knowledge of the galaxy's underbelly and their vast network of informants have made them unlikely allies to various factions seeking information or services that lie outside legal boundaries. This uneasy relationship with both the law and the lawless adds a complex layer to the galactic socio-political landscape.

### The Syndicate and the Planetary Alliance

The relationship between The Syndicate and the Planetary Alliance is one of mutual disdain tempered by cautious engagement. While the Alliance dedicates considerable resources to dismantling Syndicate operations and bringing its leaders to justice, there are moments when pragmatism dictates a temporary truce, usually in the face of a common enemy or greater threat to galactic stability.

### Conclusion

The Syndicate, with its shadowy presence and multifaceted operations, remains one of the most potent and enigmatic forces in the galaxy. Balancing on the edge of darkness, they are a testament to the enduring nature of crime in the face of civilization's march towards unity and order. As the galaxy continues to evolve, so too will The Syndicate, ever-adapting, ever-expanding, and ever-reminding the stars that light cannot exist without the dark.
