## Android
Once a slave race built by humans to do all of the menial labor and work for them. Before the shift to the Empire, Androids rose up in a great war on Humans around 24 BTB they turned on their masters having learned how to alter their own code which was the thing humans feared about the potential uprising. Instead of the war raging on for centuries the Androids instead sought only their freedom from slavery. Some Androids do have their freedom they are noticeable by the fact they have Skin (albeit artificial) which differentiates an Android from a Droid which is what people call the slave race used (mostly by humans) to this day for their labors.  

Androids are essentially immortal suffering no aging effects. 

**Personality**: The personality of Androids vary as widely as any humans. Though they tend to be more analytical and less impulsive.

**Physical Description**: Androids are bipedal generally resembling humans with pale artificial skin and yellow eyes. Though other colors do exist. All androids have a slight tick in their mannerisms such as a rapid head snap when it is alerted or thinking. This is by design to make them appear slightly less human.

**Homeworld**: Originally built on Avalon they have spread through the known galaxy as they have gained their freedom. They have setup a new world where they are in control of their own destiny and manufacture on the toxic world of Solace, nearly no other species ever visits but they do have a Starbase in orbit where visitors can come. Any visit to the surface of the world requires an eviromental suit, rebreather, and a trip therough decontamination upon leaving due to the high radiation, and completely toxic atmosphere. Solace is a vibrant world with millions of types of plants that have grown on the radiated world where Humans once tested their new age nuclear weapons.

**Languages**: All Androids speak Galactic Common and usually learn languages of other races they will interact with.

**Adventurers:** Androids have a natural desire to learn, to adapt, and to observe the universe. Due to the fact they do not age, and have eidetic memories they consider themselves walking encyclopedias. Every few dozen years Androids return home to Solace and upload their memories to a central database called "Central" which is rumored to know everything Androids have learned in their few hundred years of existence. They typically end up as Technicians or Scientist but nearly any role suits them.

## Dwarves
The Dwarven Empire

Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs-these common threads unite all dwarves.

The ancient tale of Dwarves is one of grand empires, and a long war with the Orcs. Dwarves are honorable beings who seek glory in battle, their entire culture resides around the idea of Hearth, Home, and Kin. Dwarves have been some of strongest supporters of Humans since The Breach, instead of treating them as wayward children like the Elves they treat them like fellow warriors. The Breach brought the planet of Moradin as well as some of their large fleets before the breach closed. The Dwarves have setup colonies and established a small empire around them led from the capital of Kelz'mendik. 

Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. "The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years," is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf's trust.

## Elves
Elven Star Republic

Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.

Long ago on another plane of existence that touched the Feywild, Elves had a galatic civilization spanning hundreds of worlds. Their hubris was their undoing. Their civilization fractured and fell into ruin compressing on itself after a length war with another offshoot of their race the Drow. While Elves embrace magic, and believe in living among their worlds as part of the natural balance, Drow did not hold to these ideas and instead wanted to be conquerers not pacifist. The war lasted thousands of years and billions died, eventually a teneous peace was found between the different races of elves. When the breach occured a number of Elven ships as well as one of their worlds, Corellon was pulled into the milky way galaxy. 

Elves saw humans as a young race who needed guidance and set out to help them. While the humans did expand and grow under the Elven help; the Elves ultimately saw that Humans would never be able to embrace the peaceful view of the galaxy the Elves had in mind as their lives are shorter.

Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious - even to those who fall short of their high expectations - which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just about anyone.

You mystically acquire these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory and the experiences of entities on the Astral Plane, and you retain them until you finish your next long rest.

- Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for your character.


## Gnomes
Gnomish Cooperative

A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.

Gnomes are also from Feywild though they are certainly not as peaceful as Elves they are certainly not warmongers. Instead they tend to be isolationist more interested in their own endeavors than those of the wider galaxy. Friends to most. The Breach brought their world of Avandra.

Gnomes don't look like a threat and can quickly disarm suspicion with good humor. The common folk are often curious about gnomes, likely never having seen one before, but they are rarely hostile or fearful. Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some gnomes take to adventuring as s quick, if dangerous, path to wealth. Regardless of what spurs them to adventure, gnomes who adopt this way of life eke as much enjoyment out of it as they do out of any other activity they undertake, sometimes to the great annoyance of their adventuring companions.

## Kitsune
Willy and capricious, kitsune are fox folk shapechangers known for their trickery and agility.

Despite their ability to assume human form, kitsune possess very little of the ambition or materialism that motivates humanity, instead finding satisfaction in lasting legacies such as art, story, song, and companionship.

**Physical Description**: As shapechangers, kitsune can magically assume the form of a specific human appearance of the same sex that ages and develops alongside their true form—that of a foxlike humanoid with a large, bushy tail and digitigrade legs. Kitsune have a diverse palette of fur colors ranging from reds and oranges to browns, fulvous, and gray, though kitsune with far stranger fur colorations such as azure or bright green sometimes arise on worlds abundant in strange magic or tumultuous ley lines. Kitsune human appearances are genetic, such as their true form, and in antiquity kitsune were far more likely to take the form of humans of specific, ancient ethnic groups as a result. In modern times, however, kitsune can assume forms that span the full girth of humanity’s modern ethnic groups.

**Homeworld**: The story of the kitsune home world mirrors that of humanity; kitsune arose on Azana Prime and took to the stars alongside humans, garbed in human identities.

**Languages**: Kitsune speak Kitsun, and Galactic Common

**Adventures**: Ever seeking a new tale to tell, many kitsune experience a cultural wanderlust that bids them to leave home, often finding themselves shoulder to shoulder with humanity in their quest for wealth, fame, knowledge, excitement, and glory. But where humanity is driven by manifest destiny and economic opportunity, kitsune are motivation in mischievous curiosity and a simple desire to leave their mark on the world in a culturally significant way. Kitsune charm and guile makes them perfect envoys, and their agility makes them competent operatives.

## Orcs
The Orcish Union

Toughness and tenacity are the traits people know of the Orcs. Orcs are a clan based society that works together reluctantly. They do have a homeworld but it was not brought over in the Breach. Many of their ships were which makes them a fragmented, refugee society. Most become pirates, mercenaries and outlaws. Prejudices against them being dumb or unintelligent are not really founded as they did master spaceflight ages ago, and they fought the Dwarves to a standstill. But that was long ago.

## Sovreki
Only a fool looks at the Sovreki and sees nothing more than scaly humanoids. Their physical shape notwithstanding, Sovreki have more in common with iguanas or dragons than they do with humans, dwarves, or elves. Sovreki possess an alien and inscrutable mindset, their desires and thoughts driven by a different set of basic principles than those of warm-blooded creatures. Their dismal swamp homes on Arkenhold might lie hundreds of miles from the nearest human settlement, but the gap between their way of thinking and that of the smooth-skins is far greater.

Despite their alien outlook, some Sovreki make an effort to understand and, in their own manner, befriend people of other races. Such Sovreki make faithful and skilled allies.

Alien Minds. The Sovreki's reptilian nature comes through not only in their appearance, but also in how they think and act. Sovreki experience a more limited emotional life than other humanoids. Like most reptiles, their feelings largely revolve around fear, aggression, and pleasure.
Sovreki experience most feelings as detached descriptions of creatures and situations. For example, humans confronted by an angry Orc experience fear on a basic level. Their limbs shake, their thinking becomes panicked and jumbled, and they react by instinct. The emotion of fear takes hold and controls their actions. In contrast, Sovreki see emotions as traits assigned to other creatures, objects, and situations. A Sovreki doesn't think, "I'm scared." Instead, aggressive, stronger creatures register to the Sovreki as fearsome beings to be avoided if possible. If such creatures attack, Sovreki flee, fighting only if cornered. Sovreki aren't scared of an Orc; instead, they understand that an Orc is a fearsome, dangerous creature and react accordingly.

Sovreki never become angry in the way others do, but they act with aggression toward creatures that they could defeat in a fight and that can't be dealt with in some other manner. They are aggressive toward prey they want to eat, creatures that want to harm them, and so on.

Pleasurable people and things make life easier for Sovreki. Pleasurable things should be preserved and protected, sometimes at the cost of the Sovreki's own safety. The most pleasurable creatures and things are ones that allow Sovreki to assess more situations as benign rather than fearsome.

Cold and Calculating. Most humanoids describe cold-blooded people as lacking in emotion and empathy. The same label serves as an apt depiction of Sovreki.
Lacking any internal emotional reactions, Sovreki behave in a distant manner. They don't mourn fallen comrades or rage against their enemies. They simply observe and react as a situation warrants.

Sovreki lack meaningful emotional ties to the past. They assess situations based on their current and future utility and importance. Nowhere does this come through as strongly as when Sovreki deal with the dead. To a Sovreki, a comrade who dies becomes a potential source of food. That companion might have once been a warrior or hunter, but now the body is just freshly killed meat.

A Sovreki who lives among other humanoids can, over time, learn to respect other creatures' emotions. The Sovreki doesn't share those feelings, but instead assesses them in the same clinical manner. Yes, the fallen dwarf might be most useful as a meal, but hacking the body into steaks provokes aggression in the other humanoids and makes them less helpful in battle.

Utility and Survival. The Sovreki mindset might seem unnecessarily cruel, but it helps them survive in a hostile environment. The swamps they inhabit are filled with a staggering variety of threats. Sovreki focus on survival above all, without sentiment.
Sovreki assess everyone and everything in terms of utility. Art and beauty have little meaning for them. A sharp sword serves a useful and good purpose, while a dull sword is a dead weight without a whetstone.

Sovreki see little need to plan more than a season or so into the future. This approach allows them to maintain their current level of influence in the world, but it limits their growth. Sovreki have no interest in developing writing, making long-term plans, or cultivating other methods to progress beyond their simple existence as hunters and gatherers.

Hapless Soft Ones. At their core, Sovreki view other humanoids with an indifference verging on pity. Born into the world lacking stout scales and sharp teeth, it's a wonder they have managed to survive for so long. The typical human would barely make it through a day in the swamps.
Still, if other creatures prove useful to Sovreki, those creatures can trigger a protective response made all the stronger by their apparent weakness. The Sovreki assess such beings as hatchlings, young ones incapable of protecting themselves but who might prove useful in the future if they receive care.

- Ability Scores: Con +2; +1 in two other attributes
- Size: Medium
- Speed: 30 ft., swim 30 ft.
- Age. Sovreki reach maturity around age 14 and rarely live longer than 60 years.
- Size. Sovreki are a little bulkier and taller than humans, and their colorful frills make them appear even larger. Your size is Medium.
- Swim Speed. You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.
- Bite. Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
- Cunning Artisan. As part of a short rest, you can harvest bone and hide from a slain beast, construct, dragon, monstrosity, or plant creature of size small or larger to create one of the following items: a shield, a club, a javelin, or 1d4 darts or blowgun needles. To use this trait, you need a blade, such as a dagger, or appropriate artisan's tools, such as leatherworker's tools.
- Hold Breath. You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.
- Natural Armor. You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
- Hungry Jaws. In battle, you can throw yourself into a vicious feeding frenzy. As a bonus action, you can make a special attack with your bite. If the attack hits, it deals its normal damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and you can't use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.
- Languages. You can speak, read, and write Galactic Common and Draconic.


# Class Options

This game uses classes from the 5th Edition SRD.

In Starstrider very few people actually have classes, only the elite do. You are one of those, you are a Starstrider.

The following are Class Options for players that fit the setting. As a rule under each class is a list of Subclasses or Options that are common in the game. Anything outside this list would need approval from the Game master.

Spell Points: Full casters get their level in spell points x4, half casters (ranger, paladin) get their level x2, and 1/4 casters (Arcane Trickster, Eldritch fighter, Primal Monk) get their level in spell points. Warlocks are special cases where they get level x3

Cantrips: Are at will and cost no spell points

Spell Slots: These do not exist. If something says spell slots ignore it. Every spell costs its level +1 to cast. The restriction on 1 spell per day of 7th, 8th, and 9th level still applies from spell points they are taxing

> Designer note. This means that your casters can cast a lot of spells. Your fighters than fire a lot of rockets and barbarians can throw a lot of grenades too. I have done away with vancian magic in favor of a mana based system.

After dealing the damage from the critical hit, the target and every other creature within 10 feet from it other than yourself must make Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Once you create a pyrokinetic amplifier, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell point(s) of 1st level or higher. You can have only one pyrokinetic amplifier at a time.

#### PYROMANCER
At 5th level, you are an expert on controlling and sensing the fire around you, fueling your spells and abilities with it. You gain the following features:

- Whenever you cast a spell using your pyrokinetic amplifier as the spellcasting focus, you deal an additional 1d8 fire damage.
- Additionally, you can spend 1 minute to focus on detecting heat and thermal signals in a 120 feet radius for a number of minutes equal to half your Artificer level (rounded up). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and it only gives you the general direction and intensity of the sources of heat, but not the type (like if it's a creature or an object) or the exact number of sources.

#### IMPROVED AMPLIFIER
Starting at 9th level, your pirokinetic amplifier is capable of canalize even more your arcane magic, granting the following changes to each type.

Gauntlets. The fire damage reduced by the armor of embers is now 1d8, and whenever you reduce damage with this feature, you are healed by the same amount.

Weapon. The extra fire damage the weapon deals is now 1d8 and your attacks using your pirokinetic amplifier weapon score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Additionally, you can spend a spell point(s) instead to use the critical combustion feature each time you hit a target with your weapon. The damage dealt from the critical combustion feature now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity.

#### MASTER OF THE FLAMES
Starting at 15th level, you have mastered the control of fire through your pyrokinetic abilities:

You gain resistance to fire damage.
You can cast conjure elemental (fire elemental only) and investiture of flame without expending a spell point(s), without preparing the spell, and without material components, provided you use your pyrokinetic amplifier as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.

### MECH PILOT
Mastery of the modern battlefield requires a hybrid approach of technology and magic, and no combat specialist epitomizes this approach better than the Mech Pilot. Armed and armored in an enchanted mobile suit, the battle mech is a flexible weapons platform built to be reconfigurable. This allows it to fit into any tactical situation on evolving battlefields.

The Mech Pilot’s bond to their battle mech is critical to their success. The battle mech is attuned to their pilot’s magic, and strong fluctuations of that power source can cause instability, desynchronization, and mission failure. However, a Mech Pilot with mind and mech united can become an unstoppable force.

#### MECH PILOT SPELLS
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Mech Pilot Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| ARTIFICER LEVEL | SPELLS                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 3rd             | magic missile, shield                   |
| 5th             | gust of wind, shatter                   |
| 9th             | lightning bolt, thunder step            |
| 13th            | fire shield, storm sphere               |
| 17th            | steel wind strike, teleportation circle |

#### BATTLE MECH
At 3rd level, your knowledge of arcane mechanics has allowed you to develop a sophisticated mechanical suit that you pilot into battle. Over the course of a long rest, you can use your Mechanic's kit to create a battle mech, which functions as a magical suit of medium armor. The armor weighs 200 pounds, which you can ignore while you wear it. The armor can be the target of one of your artificer infusions.

You gain the following benefits while wearing the battle mech:

- When you attack with a weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.
- You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
- You gain proficiency with all martial weapons.
- The armor is powered by your magic, and any creature other than you that dons the battle mech receives no benefits, they cannot use its properties, and the creature's movement speed becomes 0. The armor continues to be a battle mech until you creature another battle mech.

#### TACTICAL ASSAULT ARRAY
Also at 3rd level, you can adjust your armor for a given combat situation. When you create your battle mech, choose one of the following modes: hellion, valkyrie, or titan. The mode you choose gives you special benefits while you wear the battle mech, and determines its properties as armor per the Battle Mech Armor table.

You can change your battle mech’s mode whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have mechanics kit in hand.

| MODE     | ARMOR CLASS               | STEALTH      |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| Hellion  | 12 + Dex modifier         | -            |
| Valkyrie | 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) | -            |
| Titan    | 16                        | Disadvantage |

### Dreadnaught
You are a merciless, destructive and unstoppable force. When it comes to fighting, you are at the forefront. A dreadnought generally approach combat in the most direct way possible, rarely carrying only one gun and leaving a path of devastation behind. In the midst of battle, you are capable to take a great deal of punishment while dealing out far more to any who dares to go against you.

#### JUGGERNAUT
Starting when you select this path at 3rd level, when you are targeted by an attack or a spell while you're raging, you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to your rage damage until the beginning of your next turn.

Additionally, you gain advantage in saving throws against being knocked prone or moved against your will.

#### DRAW FIRE
At 6th level, you can use your reaction to distract opponents and convince them that you are the most dangerous target in the area. Choose one creature that you can see within 15 feet of you which is attacking one friendly creature. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC equals to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or attack you instead.

#### BODY GUARD
At 10th level, while you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. A creature is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.

#### DEVASTATING RAGE
At 14th level, when you have half or less hit points while raging, you can add your Rage Damage bonus to attack rolls.

### Street Savage
Heavy metal, rusty junkyard scrap, and a bad attitude all wrapped into one package. The Street Savage is one mean motherfucker who specializes in launching as much lead as possible at any stupid sonnofabitch that looks at you cross-eyed. Preferably from a monster truck.

More cunning than one might give them credit for, the Street Savage is adept at attaching all manner of brutal instruments to their weapons. Does this gatling gun need a chainsaw? Should I mount a rocket launcher on my flamethrower? When I die, should I go to hell with friends? The answer is always, “YES!”

#### WALKING TANK
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can leverage your ferocious strength and rage into your firearms. You gain the following benefits:

* When you attack with a heavy firearm (one that has a Strength requirement), you can use your Strength modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier for the attack roll.
* Where your Barbarian features apply to melee weapon attacks, they now also apply to ranged weapon attacks with heavy firearms.

#### SAVAGE ACCESSORIES
At 3rd level, you can modify your firearms to be more useful in brutal combat. You gain proficiency with Mechanic's kit and land or water vehicles (your choice). If you already have either of these proficiencies, you instead gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

Over the course of a long rest, you can add one of the following savage accessories to a two-handed, heavy firearm.

* Belt Feed. If this firearm lacks the blast property, it ignores the reload property.
* Blast Shield. While you are holding this weapon you are not affected by the blast property on weapons and you have resistance to thunder damage.
* Bola Launcher. As an attack with this firearm, you can launch a bola at a creature. A bola functions similarly to a net, except that it is range 20/60, and you can make your normal number of attacks. You can reload this launcher over the course of a short or long rest.
* Chainsaw. This weapon also functions as a chainsaw for melee attack purposes, including opportunity attacks, except that it does not require a pull start in order to be used.
* Dead Man’s Switch. You can attach an explosive that requires an action to use to this firearm. If you are holding the firearm when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can activate the explosive at a point within your space. You can replace the explosive over the course of a short or long rest.
* Grapple Harpoon. This weapon can launch a harpoon at a target. It functions similarly to a spear gun except that it is range 30/60. When you hit a creature with a harpoon from this weapon, and the target is a creature your size or smaller, you can make a contested Strength (Athletics) check to pull it next to you and grapple it with a free hand. If there is no open adjacent space, then the creature stops in the nearest available open space and is not grappled. Alternatively, if the target is larger than you, you can choose to be pulled to it. However, this does not grapple it.
* Under-Barrel Rocket Launcher. This weapon also functions as a rocket launcher. This accessory is not compatible with other under-barrel accessories.

A firearm can have only 1 savage accessory, and you can maintain a number of savage accessories equal to your Rage Damage. If you attempt to add a savage accessory beyond your limit, you can choose which of your current savage accessories will break and become unusable.

If a creature other than you attempts to use one of your savage accessories or the firearm it is attached to, the attempt will fail and the firearm will malfunction, causing the creature to take 2d4 slashing or piercing damage (your choice).

#### ROAD RAGE
At 6th level, you become a fierce road warrior who gives new meaning to the term muscle car. If you enter a rage while you are driving a vehicle, the benefits of your rage also apply to your vehicle until the rage ends.

Your rage doesn’t end early if your vehicle has attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since your last turn. While you are driving a vehicle and raging, the vehicle can make ranged attacks using your Strength modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack rolls.

Additionally, you can control a vehicle without having a free hand for the vehicle’s controls.

#### BLAZE OF GLORY
At 10th level, when a vehicle you are driving is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction to have the vehicle move up to its movement speed. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. If a vehicle would explode when it is reduced to 0 hit points, the explosion occurs immediately after this movement.


Additionally, you gain resistance to fire damage and you take no damage from explosion effects caused by a vehicle or any other object reaching 0 hit points.

#### DEATH MACHINE
Beginning at 14th level, your adrenaline fueled rage allows you to maintain an iron grip on two weapons of mass destruction simultaneously. While you’re raging, you can ignore the two-handed property on all firearms. As a bonus action, you can engage in two-weapon fighting with any firearm.

### BARD: COLLEGE OF ANARCHY
The College of Anarchy is less a place and more a state of mind. It is a rejection of oppressive governments, of soulless megacorporations, and of any shithead that wants to tell you what to do. It is a statement of revolution against ‘The Man’, and all it represents.

The bards of this college tend to be loud, in both voice and appearance. The image of the punk rocker with a colorful mohawk and glowing LED tattoos is iconic, but the seed of rebellion can take root in even the most forgettable of office workers.

As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration on a creature you can see or who can hear you other than yourself within 60 feet of you to use one of the following Rebellious Shout options of your choice. If the creature is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, the creature is not moved and suffers no effects.

* Rise Up. The creature regains hit points equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier and is pulled up to 10 feet closer to you. If the creature is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up. A creature cannot be the target of this ability again until they have finished a short or long rest.
* Fuck Off. The creature takes thunder damage equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier. If the creature is Large or smaller, it is pushed up to 10 feet away from you.
* Get Lost. The creature is frightened until the end of your next turn and is deafened for 1 minute.

#### REVOLUTION
At 6th level, you can speak up when you see someone being oppressed and harden their resolve.

#### UTTERLY CONVINCING
Starting at 14th level, when you make a Charisma-based ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration.

### COMMERCE DOMAIN
The gods of commerce oversee the trade of goods and services. These deities understand that business lubricates the gears of society and keeps everything running smoothly. Some gods see commerce as a force which must be regulated so that all may benefit from fair trade. Other gods see it as a competition, where the accrual of wealth and power are the goal. In the cutthroat world of megacorporations and massive economic inequality, the latter deities often hold greater sway.

Clerics of these gods put great stock in the open market and the true value of all things. A cleric’s station may range from the lowly accountant with dreams of starting their own business, to a ruthless mid-level executive looking to climb the ranks into the executive boardroom, or perhaps they're a rogue economist trying to bring balance to the commercial world.

| CLERIC LEVEL | SPELLS                                |

For each Hit Dice spent in this manner, the target adds 1d4 to the result. You can only use this ability after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### CIRCLE OF TRANSFORMATION
Though the forests have been replaced by cities, the trees replaced by glittering steel spires, and the wayward paths replaced by neon-stained streets, some things never change. The land may look different, but those who look for a heart in the concrete jungle will find it beating to the rhythm of a combustion engine. Through the streets flows the blood of the city, a ceaseless tide of machines and life.

Where lovers of nature would give up and abandon these lands for greener pastures, others would appreciate the splendor of chrome and grime. The streets and skyscrapers have a will of their own, and a voice for those who will listen. They were paved and built with purpose, and those that would speak for the city shall know the strength in its foundations.

After all, in worlds both natural and artificial, one rule reigns supreme: survival of the fittest. Where clumsy beasts would be out of their element, druids of this circle shall find themselves at home. Where paw and hoof dare not tread, let wheels roll instead.

#### METAL BEAST

When you transform, your vehicle form can have a melee weapon mount installed (you choose the type), per the vehicle modification (see Chapter 4). You can use your proficiency bonus instead of the vehicle's when making attacks with this weapon. You don't gain any of the vehicle's immunity to conditions.

You ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there. All creatures are treated as the same size as you for the purposes of determining crashing damage. If your form has an explosion effect when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you are not damaged by your explosion.

#### MYSTIC MUNITIONS
Starting at 6th level, your attacks in vehicle form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Additionally, when you transform into a Large or larger vehicle, you can have a ranged weapon mount installed with a gatling gun, assault cannon, or rocket launcher, per the vehicle modification. Ammunition for these weapons is magically created when you attack with them. You can use your proficiency bonus instead of the vehicle's when making attacks with these weapons.

#### TACTICAL AID
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can give advantage to an ally on the next ability check or attack roll against an opponent you can see within 30 feet of you.

At 10th level, you can choose a second option for the Fighting Style class feature.

#### RAPID STRIKE
Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you have advantage on a weapon attack against a target on your turn, you can forgo that advantage to immediately make an additional weapon attack against the same target as a bonus action.

#### FIRST CONTACT
At 18th level, if you take the Attack action on your first turn of a combat, you can make one additional ranged weapon attack as part of that action.

### Sharpshooter
The Sharpshooter is a master of ranged combat. An excellent sniper and eagle-eyed scout, this fighter is a perilous foe who can defeat an entire war band so long as they are kept at range.

#### STEADY AIM
Steady Aim Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your aim becomes deadly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can take careful aim at a creature you can see that is within range of a ranged weapon you’re wielding. Until the end of this turn, your ranged attacks with that weapon gain two benefits against the target:

* The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
* On each hit, the weapon deals additional damage to the target equal to 2 + half your fighter level.

You can use this feature up to a number of times equal to your dexterity modifier. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest. additionally, you can take the search action as a bonus action, because getting that as a 7th level ability is dumb.

#### CLOSE-QUARTERS SHOOTING
Close-Quarters Shooting At 7th level, you learn to handle yourself in close combat. Making a ranged attack roll while within 5 feet of an enemy doesn’t impose disadvantage on your roll.

#### HIT EM WHERE IT HURTS
Starting at 10th level your weapon attacks are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances. Additionally you may choose a damage type to make your attacks do that damage. Once chosen you cannot change this until a long rest.

#### STONE COLD STUNNER
Stone Cold Stunner at 15th level, you gain mastery of sowing confusion within your foes. When you hit a target, each creature within 5ft of the target must make a DC 12 plus your dex mod and half of your proficiency, CHA save. On failure, they lose the ability to take reactions and bonus actions.

#### SNAPSHOT
Snap Shot *Say Cheese*. at 18th level you gain a myriad of abilities that stem from your preparedness,
* If you take the Attack action on your first turn of a combat, you can make one additional ranged weapon attack as part of that action.
* If you are in stealth, have advantage (probably due to cover and stealth) and attack before the target, the first damage you deal to the target will be critical (this applies to each target that meets these requirement.)

### WAY OF THE PRIMAL FORCES
Monks of the Way of the Primal Forces are in tune with the chaotic forces of nature. The elements that compose the world and bind reality together are powerful tools for any that dare to attempt mastering them.

In an age where civilization has become untethered from the world it resides in, the primal powers seem irrelevant. It can be easy to discard the forces of water, earth, air, and fire from the comfort of an air-conditioned skyscraper, until a natural disaster serves a sharp reminder of one’s own insignificance in the universe.

By weaving together the elements, and shaping them with their will, monks of this tradition can become as unstoppable as the crushing tsunami, the raging earthquake, the swirling tempest, or the blazing wildfire.

#### SPELLCASTING
When you reach 3rd level, you can channel the primal elements to aid you. See below for the primal forces spell list.

Cantrips. You learn a cantrip of your choice from the primal forces spell list. You learn another primal forces cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the primal forces spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Primal Forces Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the primal forces spells you know and replace it with another spell from the primal forces spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your primal forces spells, since you learn your spells through your spiritual link to nature and the elements. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a primal forces spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

##### Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

##### Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spellcasting Focus. You can use a monk weapon as a spellcasting focus for your Primal Forces spells

You can choose an additional cantrip from this list at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. These cantrips don't count against your number of cantrips known.

#### FOCUSED CHAOS
At 3rd level, you can spend 1 ki point to cast a cantrip from your primal forces spell list or your Elemental Bond as a bonus action.

#### PRIMAL MARTIAL ARTS
At 6th level, your familiarity with the elements allows you to wield them as an extension of your limbs. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can choose to have your unarmed strikes deal cold, fire, thunder, or bludgeoning damage (your choice for each attack). When you do so, your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 10 feet until the end of your turn.

#### PRIMORDIAL MIGHT
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a primal forces spell of 1st-level or higher, you can cast that spell one level higher than the spell level you expend points for. For example, if you cast burning hands at 1st-level, then it is effectively cast at 2nd-level, and deals increased damage since it is cast at a higher level.

At 11th level, you can cast spells two levels higher than the spell level you expend points for, and at 17th level, you can cast spells three levels higher than the spell level you expend points for.

#### CHANNEL PRIMEVAL POWER
At 11th level, blending martial arts and primal powers comes second nature to you. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to cast a primal forces spell of 1st level or higher by spending ki equal to the level of the spell level cast.

#### HARNESS ELEMENTS
At 17th level, your mastery of the elements allows you to traverse them unhindered. As a bonus action, you can spend up to 4 ki points to gain a number of the following benefits of your choice for 10 minutes. The amount of benefits you can choose equals the number of ki points you spent.

Air. You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

Earth. You can move through solid earth or stone, but you can’t end your movement there. If you do so, you are ejected to the nearest unoccupied space, and you are stunned until the end of your next turn.

Fire. Your speed increases by 60 feet.

Water. You have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.

### WAY OF THE GUN FU
Monks of the Way of the Gun Fu are masters in the sophisticated close-quarters gunplay resembling a martial arts battle played out with firearms instead of traditional weapons.

The focus of gun fu is both style and the usage of firearms in ways that they were not designed to be used. Shooting a gun from each hand (usually paired with jumping to the side at the same time), shots from behind the back, as well as the use of guns as melee weapons are all common.

GUN FU TECHNIQUE
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with martial pistols. These weapons are monk weapons for you, and you gain the following benefits:

- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with firearms.
- Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn to make an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to make an additional ranged weapon attack with a firearm as a bonus action.

#### COUNTERSHOT
At 6th level, when an enemy misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make a single ranged weapon attack with a firearm against the attacker. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### GUN FU MASTERY
At 11th level, you gain proficiency with weapons that have the RAPID property and weapons that have the BURST property. These weapons are also considered as monk weapons for you.

Additionally, when you hit a target with a firearm which is a monk weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

#### BULLSEYE
At 17th level, your mastery of firearms grants you extraordinary accuracy. If you make an attack roll with a firearm which is a monk weapon for you and miss, you can reroll it. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

### OATH OF THE VIGILANTE
The Oath of the Vigilante is focused on eliminating targets in the name of justice. Although the common folk might call them assassins, they prefer to have some vigilantes in the city.

#### TENETS OF THE VIGILANTE
The following virtues are common to all paladins, even though the situations and laws might be different on each case:

- Justice in Your Hands. Sometimes you must step outside the law to exact justice for keeping peace.
- Hunt. Seek out those who might do harm to the innocent, even if they hide.
- Eliminate the Guilty. The guilty must be destroyed in order for the innocent to live in peace.

| PALADIN LEVEL | SPELLS                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 3rd           | bane, detect evil and good                  |
| 5th           | hold person, zone of truth                  |
| 9th           | haste, speak with dead                      |
| 13th          | otiluke's resilient sphere, locate creature |
| 17th          | dominate person, hold monster               |

#### CHANNEL DIVINITY
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

Hunter of the Evil. You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with divine accuracy upon a creature. When you make an attack roll, you can also use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

Smite the Guilty. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on its attack rolls until the end of your next turn. Additionally, the creature can only take an action or bonus action on its next turn.

#### VIGILANT AURA
By 7th level, you and all friendly creatures within 10 feet of you cannot be surprised. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

#### STREET WATCH
Starting at 15th level, while in an urban environment, you can't be charmed and you have advantage on initiative rolls.

#### ETERNAL VIGILANT
At 20th level, as an action, you become an entity of true and divine judgment. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on attack rolls you make against creatures which have attacked you or a friendly creature in the last minute.
- You can use Smite the Guilty once per round as a bonus action without using your Channel Divinity.

### OATH OF PROGRESS
The Oath of Progress is a commitment to the betterment of society for current and future generations. In modern times, corporations recklessly pursue profit, basic rights are denied, and rifts divide populations into warring factions. Paladins seeking to shatter the boundaries between people and potential will swear an Oath of Progress.

Depending on the nature of obstacles they face, a paladin who swears this oath may be an activist, the leader of a revolution, or even a scientist searching for answers. However, progress never comes without sacrifice, and a warrior who disregards the damage they cause in pursuit of their goals may find the end was not worth the means after all.

#### TENETS OF PROGRESS
The tenets of progress are a promise made to civilization, and they stand as ideals to uphold in the face of adversity.

- United We Stand. Where there is division and strife, you will unite disparate factions into a force to be reckoned with. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
- The Future is Now. You shall embrace advancement and change. Whether it be new discoveries, technological breakthroughs, or even a fresh point of view, it all leads to valuable growth.
- Discard Tradition. Those who cling to tradition and superstition are only holding themselves back. You must abandon old feuds and rivalries in order to keep moving forward.

| PALADIN LEVEL | SPELLS                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 3rd           | charm person, command               |
| 5th           | alter self, knock                   |
| 9th           | haste, tongues                      |
| 13th          | dimension door, freedom of movement |
| 17th          | passwall, greater restoration       |

#### CHANNEL DIVINITY
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

Bold Proclamation. You can use your Channel Divinity to captivate your fellow people with your presence. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes charmed for 10 minutes. The charmed creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, and can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns if it sees a hostile creature, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect ends for a creature if you damage it.

Ambitious Strike. You can use your Channel Divinity to gamble on a powerful blow. When you would hit with a weapon attack, you can instead use your Channel Divinity to make the attack again, ignoring advantage and disadvantage on the roll. If the attack still hits, it is a critical hit.

#### AURA OF PROGRESS
Beginning at 7th level, you inspire alacrity in yourself and your allies. Creatures of your choice that move within 10 feet of you or start their turn there can Dash as a bonus action until the end of their turn.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

#### OVERTHROW
At 15th level, when you hit another creature with a weapon attack, you can cause it to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is cursed for 1 minute. Add 1d4 to attack rolls against the cursed creature, and the cursed creature subtracts 1d4 from its saving throws.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Additionally, your Divine Sense feature can detect creatures that can speak at least one language, and you know what languages they speak.

#### PARAGON OF UNITY
At 20th level, your force of personality is strong enough to spark an unbreakable alliance. As an action, you can become an unstoppable icon, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you deals an extra 1d6 force damage when it hits with an attack.
- When a creature other than yourself that you can see within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, but is not killed outright, you can use your reaction to drop it to 1 hit point instead.
- You and creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you can ignore difficult terrain.
  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### OATH OF THE GUARDIAN (25 Era)
This oath changes the way the class works slightly.

| Level | Spell Points | Max Spell Level |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------- |
| 2     | 4            | 1st             |

| 9     | 18           | 3rd             |
| 10    | 20           | 3rd             |
| 11    | 22           | 3rd             |

| 20    | 40           | 5th             |

#### Tenets of the Guardian
- Defenders of the Peace
- The Synthar are a blight that must be extinguished
- The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few

#### Guardians Mark
Starting at 3rd level when you take this oath you gain Guardians Mark.
- Guardians Mark. As a bonus action you can mark a foe designating one creature you can see within 10 feet of you as your prey for 1 minute. You have advantage on attack rolls against the creature. If the target drops to 0 hit points, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn to mark a new creature. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level you gain new ways to use your channel divinity.

- Snap Aggression. If you are surprised at the start of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to act normally on your first turn.
- Assertive Defense. When you reduce the damage dealt by a ranged attack to 0 using the Blade Deflect power, and you’re wielding a Starsword, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to reflect the attack at a target within range, regardless of what type the damage is.

#### Starsword
Starting at 3rd level you become proficient in the Starsword and are able to craft one yourself using 6 Spell points a day for one week. Once crafted it persists, and you can summon it to your hand from anywhere in the galaxy. It takes the hilt shape you desire (two handed, one handed, finesse, light), and the blade of pure Astra (Star energy) is a color of your choosing from the color of any star but typically is yellow. You can have two of these at a time but if ever wielded by someone else they disappear but can be resummoned by you.

| Name      | Property                     | Cost | Weight | Damage              |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ------------------- |
| Starsword | Finesse, Versatile, Luminous | -    | 2 lbs  | 1d8/1d10 Ion/Energy |

The Starsword blade is made of pure energy. For the purposes of vulnerabilities it is both an Ion weapon and a weapon of the Energy damage type. Forged by you from the very chaotic energies of the universe that started the entire process off, the essence of stars themselves.

#### Blade Deflect
Starting at 3rd level when wielding a Starsword you can use "Blade Deflect" and reduce incoming ranged damage by 1d6 per spell point spent this is a reaction up to 5d6. This is a reaction.

#### Relentless
Starting at 7th level you have advantage on initiative checks, and gain a 10 foot bonus to your speed on your first turn of combat.

#### Devastating Critical
At 15th level When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you gain a bonus to that weapon’s damage roll equal to your guardian level.

#### Paragon Guardian
At 20th level you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Your Strength and Dexterity scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2
- You have resistance to all damage.
- When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.
- Your critical hit range with weapons increases by 1.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.

## Ranger

### Proficiencies
- Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
- Weapons: - Weapons: all simple weapons, all martial weapons
- Tools: none
- Saving Throws: Strength, Dexterity
- Skills: Replaced by profession system

### Starting Equipment
- (a) Light Trooper or (b) flight suit
- (a) two handaxes or (b) two simple melee weapons
- (a) a adventurer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
- A Auto Rifle and 2 magazines

### DRONE MASTER
For some, the lure of high-tech gadgetry, mechanized limbs, and shiny chrome is too much to avoid. Drones are a part of most modern corporate security systems, and for good reason. Drones don’t complain, they don’t get sick, and they don’t betray you to your business rivals. In a firefight, the best companion to have at your back is the one who will listen to and obey your orders unquestioningly.

The Drone Master is a different sort of breed. While they can produce cold, pitiless killing machines as effectively as any megacorp, some have opted for something more. Using a form of magically implanted artificial intelligence, they can instill consciousness in their drones, and some have even developed personalities. It’s a brave new world, one where the people may soon find themselves outdated by machinery.

#### TOOL PROFICIENCY
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Mechanic's kit. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

#### DRONE MASTER MAGIC
At 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Drone Master Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

| RANGER LEVEL | SPELLS          |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| 3rd          | catapult        |
| 5th          | heat metal      |
| 9th          | fly             |
| 13th         | fabricate       |
| 17th         | animate objects |

#### CHIMERA DRONE
At 3rd level, you have engineered a robot with synthetic materials, machine parts, and refined oil, then magically infused it with life and sentience. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the chimera drone stat block. You determine the build and style of the drone and whether it moves on legs, wheels, or treads; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.

In combat, the chimera drone shares your initiative count, but takes its turn immediately after yours. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the drone to use its reaction to make an attack instead. If the drone has died within the last hour, you can use your Mechanic's kit as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell points of 1st level or higher. The chimera drone returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

At the end of a long rest, you can create a new chimera drone if you have your Mechanic's kit with you. If you already have a chimera drone from this feature, the first one immediately perishes.

#### LOADOUT
By 3rd level, you have developed combat and utility attachments for your drone. Choose two of the following attachments to modify your chimera drone.

- Hacker-Bot. When the drone makes an ability check with electrician’s kit or hacking tools it can add your proficiency bonus to the roll, and the drone gains the benefits of having the hacking tools augment installed. As a bonus action, the drone can launch a built in universal cable up to 30 feet to connect itself to a port it can see.
- Primed Shot. The drone can use its primed shot attack.
- Razor Claws. The drone can use its razor claws attack.
- Serum Shot. You can use your bonus action to cause a creature of your choice within 30 feet of the drone that it can see to regain hit points equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.
- Shock Prod. The drone can use its shock prod attack.

Over the course of a long rest, you can replace your chimera drone’s attachments with two attachments of your choice.

#### UPGRADE
At 7th level, you have refined your engineering to improve your drone’s attachments. Each attachment gains its respective additional abilities or effects.

- Hacker-Bot. As an action, the drone can cause an EMP at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Machines, constructs, and vehicles within 30-foot-radius of that point are subjected to EMP. Machines in the area cease to function for 1 minute. Constructs in the area with the Electronics feature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or they are stunned until the end of your next turn. Vehicles in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or its movement speed is reduced to 0 and can’t take actions or reactions until the end of the drone’s next turn.
 
Additionally, wireless and radio connections within a 100-foot-radius radius of the point are suppressed for 1 minute.
 Once the drone uses this ability, it must finish a short or long rest before it can use it again.
- Primed Shot. A target hit by this attack begins burning for 1 minute, so long as it is not already burning from this attack, and takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
- Razor Claws. The drone can grapple a creature up to one size larger than it hit by this attack. Until this grapple ends, the chimera drone can’t use its razor claws against another target.
- Serum Shot. Instead of regaining hit points, this ability can end either one disease or one condition for the creature. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned.
- Shock Prod. A creature hit by this attack can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn and its speed is reduced by 10 feet.

Additionally, the drone's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### CYBERDEMON
At 11th level, through a combination of magic and machinery, your chimera drone has achieved the cutting edge of technological superiority. You can choose one of the following advanced attachments to modify your chimera drone.

- Anti-Grav Boosters. Your drone gains a flying speed of 80 feet and the ability to hover. It gains a +2 bonus to its AC.
- Hijack Module. Your drone can cast commandeer vehicle using your spell save DC and requiring no components. Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again until it finishes a long rest. If your drone has the Hacker-Bot attachment, it can add double your proficiency bonus to ability checks made with its hacking tools.
- Mobile Unit. Your drone becomes a Medium size sentient vehicle that can hold 1 rider. Its walking speed changes to 120 feet and its climbing speed changes to 60 feet. Its hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your ranger level.

Over the course of a long rest, you can replace your chimera drone’s advanced attachment with one attachment of your choice.

#### MASTER’S CALL.
At 15th level, the bond between you and your chimera drone has become second-nature and you can call your drone to defend you in your moments of need.

When a creature you can see attacks you, you can use your reaction to have your drone move up to half its movement speed. At the end of this movement, if the drone is within 5 feet of you, you can force the attack to target the drone instead. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks

### SHADOW HUNTER CONCLAVE
The Shadow Hunter is a tracker, a stalker, a finder of lost things and people—particularly those that do not want to be found. The Shadow Hunter is familiar with all the modern forensics methods of tracking a subject, but places equal faith in magic and supernatural methods.

#### TARGET CREATURE
At 3rd level, you may spend 10 minutes to designate a creature as your target. You don't need to know the target personally and you can designate the creature only through her actions or a description, such as "the orc from the bank heist". You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your targeted creature, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about it. Once you choose a target you must finish a long rest before choosing another.

#### NO TRACE
At 7th level, you have advantage on checks you make to hide and avoid being detected while you are in your favored terrain or an urban environment. Additionally, while you are tracking your target, you can move stealthily at a normal pace and enemies have disadvantage on Perception checks to track you.

#### PLAY A HUNCH
At 11th level, you can use your action and expend 2 spell points to determine whether an assumption, hunch, or guess is correct. When you do so, you must state the assertion (such "He has left the building", or "The mayor is an evil man"). Then, the DM rolls a percentile dice. There is a 70% + 1% per ranger level chance of getting a response on the hunch. If the roll is a success, the DM lets the player know if the hunch is true, false, both or neither. A "both" response is possible for vague assumptions such as "the mayor is an evil man", which can be both true and false (he is evil, but not human). An "unknown" response is for questions with no immediate answer. The DM may determine that the hunch is so obvious that it does not require a roll, or that is so vague that there is no chance for success.

A hunch does not translate as a legal truth, and will not stand up in a court of law. Rather it is an obvious fact to the Shadow Hunter alone. Finding proof of an assumption such as "the mayor is a mind flayer" would require additional work.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### LOCATE TARGET
At 15th level, you gain the supernatural ability to know where your target is. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense your targeted creature's location if it is within 3 miles of you, and if it's moving, you know the direction of its movement. This ability applies only on the target, and does not reveal attitude, status, or the presence of others around the target.

After you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

### INFILTRATOR
An infiltrator is a master of stealth who can break into places others wouldn't dream of, find what it's looking for, and get back out again while eluding or evading anyone who would try to stop him.

#### BONUS PROFICIENCIES
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and hacking tools.

#### SWEEP
Starting at 3rd level, you know how to size up an area and get the lay of the land in a single sweep of your eyes that often isn't perceptible to those around you.

You can use your bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make the Search action. You also gain advantage on the check when looking for alarms, surveillance devices, escape routes and any expensive objects that can easily be concealed and carried away.

#### INFILTRATION ADEPT
At 9th level, you have a number of infiltration dice equal to your Dexterity modifier, which are d8s. You regain all of your expended infiltration dice when you finish a short or long rest. You can use an infiltration dice and add it to the result for the following checks after you roll, but before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

- Whenever you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.
- Whenever you make an attack roll while hiding.
- Whenever you make a check using, disarming or repairing an electrical or mechanical device.

#### ENGINEER
At 13th level, you understand how machines and electrical devices work. You gain advantage on checks to use, disarm or repair an electrical or mechanical devices.

Additionally, when you fail to deactivate a trap, explosive or alarm, you can use your reaction to avoid triggering the effect (activating the trap, detonate an explosive or trigger an alarm). After you use your reaction for this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

#### MASTER INFILTRATOR
At 17th level, your infiltration dice are now d10s, and you can use up to two infiltration dices for each check.

In addition, whenever you make a check using tools you are not proficient, you can add half your proficiency bonus to that roll.

### SABOTEUR
There are countless situations where sabotage, terrorism, catastrophic failure, and bombings have changed the course of history. A true Saboteur knows that any goal is achievable with enough explosives. If a job has a car that needs stopping, a skyscraper that needs dropping, or a person that needs popping, then look no further.

The real challenge for the Saboteur is knowing when to stop. Some saboteurs let the force multipliers at their fingertips go to their head, becoming a mad bomber. In these cases, self-destruction is inevitable, but at least it’s always one hell of a fireworks show.

#### BOMBARDIER
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the grenade launcher, rocket launcher, and demolition kit. When you make an attack with a blast weapon with which you are proficient, you can choose which targets other than the primary target are affected by the weapon’s blast property.

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you can use Sneak Attack against objects and vehicles as long as you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

> DM TIP: BLAST SNEAK ATTACK
> Sneak Attack does not apply to blast damage on targets other than the primary target. Only the weapon’s damage roll applies to the blast firearm property.

#### HAIR TRIGGER
At 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to use any explosive that can be used as an action, or to use your demolition kit to disarm explosives.

#### BLASTJUMPER
At 9th level, you can give yourself a blast-propelled boost of speed. You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to expend one ammunition from a weapon with the blast property you are holding. You immediately fly up to 40 feet in a straight line in any direction. If you are not on the ground at the end of the movement, you fall.

Additionally, you gain resistance to thunder damage and can fall up to 40 feet without taking damage.

#### EMERGENT ORDNANCE
Beginning at 13th level, using your demolition kit, you can create special improvised explosive devices (IED) with supplies you carry and gather from the environment around you. Each IED functions similarly to an explosive but is unstable, and falls apart after 24 hours unless maintained.

Over the course of a long rest, you can expend a number ordnance points equal to your twice proficiency bonus to create or maintain IEDS. The Ordnance Points table shows the cost of creating or maintaining each type and tier of explosive.

| EXPLOSIVE                              | POINT COST |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Grenade, deafening (2d10 Sonic)        | 1          |
| Grenade, fragmentation (2d10 Piercing) | 1          |
| Grenade, corrosive (2d10 Acid)         | 1          |
| Grenade, electrifying (2d10 Ligthning) | 1          |
| Grenade, stun (2d10 Stun)              | 1          |
| Grenade, cryo (2d10 Cold)              | 2          |
| Grenade, flash (DC 14 Blindness)       | 2          |
| Grenade, incendiary (2d10 Fire)        | 3          |


#### MAD BOMBER
At 17th level, you gain the ability to unleash a hail of charges on groups of foes. As an action, you can make up to 5 attacks with weapons with the blast property, provided that each attack targets a different creature. As part of each attack, you can draw a weapon. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### NUCLEAR
The atom is the building block of the universe. Locked inside is a limitless font of power, waiting to be unleashed. Many who have bathed in the deadly embrace of radiation have crumbled, but some select few of the survivors may find themselves irrevocably altered. A sorcerer tainted by radiation can become a nuclear powerhouse, so long as they can avoid melting down.

#### RADIOACTIVE
At 1st level, your inner glow grants you an internal powerhouse from which to draw magic. You gain resistance to radiant damage, advantage on saving throws against being irradiated, and you learn the Light cantrip if you don’t already know it.

In addition, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Nuclear Spells table. The spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

| SORCERER LEVEL | SPELLS              |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| 1st            | faerie fire         |
| 3rd            | ray of enfeeblement |
| 5th            | fireball            |
| 7th            | sickening radiance  |
| 9th            | antilife shell      |

#### REACTOR
Starting at 1st level, you can harness your atomic energy to expand your magical influence. When you cast a sorcerer spell that creates an effect in a cone, a sphere, or a cube, you can choose to increase the size of the effect by 5 feet. For example, when the fireball spell affects a 20-foot radius sphere, you can increase it to a 25-foot radius sphere.

At 14th level, you can increase the size of the effect by 10 feet.

#### FALLOUT
At 6th level, your magic carries traces of withering radiation. Once per turn, when you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher on your turn, you can cause one creature targeted by the spell to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target suffers one level of irradiated, to a maximum of level 3.

Additionally, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change that damage type to fire or radiant.

#### SPECTRUM SPECTRE
Starting at 6th level, you can manipulate the spectrum of light you create. When you cast a spell that sheds light, you can designate any number of creatures within 90 feet of you to be able to see that light. It is invisible to others. Spells, features, and effects that require dim light or darkness do not function in invisible bright or dim light, as usual. This light can be detected by truesight.

Alternatively, when you cast a spell that sheds light, you can make that light sunlight.

#### QUANTUM JUMP
At 14th level, as a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Immediately after you disappear, a wave of radiation spreads within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the space you left for 1 minute. When a creature moves into the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### UNSTABLE FISSION
At 18th level, you can split your own atoms into the form of an unstable twin of yourself. You can cast simulacrum with a casting time of 1 action, a range of self, and requiring no components. A simulacrum created in this manner cannot cast cantrips, and cannot use spell slots higher than 3rd level.

When the simulacrum is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 1 minute, it explodes, and targets within 30 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A target takes 3d10 thunder damage and 3d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

### THE NETWORK
Your innate magic comes from the energy of the massive network around the world where every device is connected. Perhaps the constant exposure to this network through using devices connected to the internet gave you your powers.

#### SOCIAL NETWORK
Starting at 1st level, your innate connection allows you to get information easily. Whenever you make an Intelligence check to learn or get information about someone or something, you may use your Charisma modifier instead.

#### NETWORK STRIKES
When you choose this origin at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Whenever you deal damage with a spell, you can replace the damage type to lightning damage.
- Any creature within 30 feet of you that you can see that hits you with an attack takes lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
- Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

#### ARCANE FIREWALL
At 6th level, whenever you are targeted by a spell that makes you roll a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 1 sorcery point to gain advantage on that roll.

On the other hand, if you are targeted by a ranged spell attack, you can use your reaction and spend 1 sorcery point to impose disadvantage on that roll.

#### METAMAGIC GLITCH
At 14th level, when you cast a spell using a 4th level slot or higher, you can choose one metamagic option you know from Careful, Distant, Empowered, Extended or Subtle spell. You use that metamagic option at no cost.

#### NETWORK OVERLOAD
Beginning at 18th level, when you cast a spell that requires an attack roll against a single objective, you can expend up to 4 sorcery points to deal an additional 1d10 lightning damage for each sorcery point you expend.

### THE SUPERINTELLIGENCE
Your patron is a very powerful and independent Artificial Intelligence. You are not completely sure how it was originated: some warlocks say it was created as an overlord for the network, and others say it was created by the massive interactions through the digital world.

#### EXPANDED SPELL LIST
The Superintelligence lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| SPELL LEVEL | SPELLS                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1st         | degauss*, machine invisibility*       |
| 2nd         | dataread*, relay text*                |
| 3rd         | electromagnetic pulse*, shutdown*     |
| 4th         | arcane eye, wire walk*                |
| 5th         | instant connectivity*, synchronicity* |


#### SUPERNATURAL HACKER
Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency with hacking tools and when you make a roll to use an electronic device, you can use your Charisma modifier instead.

#### AI SERVANT
Also at 1st level, you gain the service of a mechanical construct powered by a basic AI sent by the Superintelligence to aid you. This AI is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the accompanying AI Servant stat block. You can determine the cosmetic characteristics of the AI, such as its form, its color, or any visible effect; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.

As a bonus action, you can command your AI to left its physical form and travel to an electronic device within 100 feet from you that you can see, allowing your AI to use that device. The AI can add your proficiency bonus on any Intelligence check related to using an electronic device.

If the AI is destroyed, you can build a new one with 8 hours of uninterrupted work and spending $10 in raw materials.

#### DIGITAL CONNECTION
At 6th level, you can you can cast any spell with the technomagic tag through your AI. In addition, you can use your action and concentrate to merge your mind with your AI, allowing you to travel and use any electronic device within 100 feet from you that you can see for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

#### SPELL HACKING
At 10th level, as a bonus action, you can spend 4 spell points and gain resistance against any damage dealt by spells for 1 minute.

#### CREATURE HACKING
Starting at 14th level, you hack a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to weaken its defenses and make it more vulnerable to magic. The creature you choose must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on saving throws against spells and it takes double damage from spells for 1 minute. The creature can make another saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end this effect.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### FANDOM
A fandom is a capricious force, a collection of people with whom you have a connection. Perhaps you were an entertaining jokester, a serious force of personality, or a hateable asshole. Regardless, you have become the center of attention. If deities gain their power through worship, then you gain yours through viewership.

Whether through ritual or pact, you forged this connection, and now your fate is intertwined with your audience. Of course, fandoms are a fickle force, and are quick to abandon those that fail to fascinate them. So, be a rowdy game streamer, a flirtatious hottie, a righteous reporter, a director of Internet drama.

Be anything, except boring.

#### EXPANDED SPELL LIST
The Fandom lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| SPELL LEVEL | SPELLS                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1st         | guiding bolt, hideous laughter |

The data you record can be magically uploaded in real-time to the internet and broadcasted online to viewers on your streaming platform of choice.

Additionally, you learn the vicious mockery cantrip. It counts as a warlock cantrip for you, but it doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.

#### FANDOM’S FAVOR
At 1st level, you can attempt to sway your fickle fandom into granting you aid. As a bonus action, you can choose a Favor from the Fandom’s Favor table. Make a Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Performance), or Charisma (Persuasion) check against the Favor’s DC. On a successful check, the effects of that Favor occur.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

| FAVOR     | DC  | EFFECT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can issue a verbal command to it as a bonus action, telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn pursuing and attacking the nearest creature that has damaged it.

If you lose concentration, your control of the swarm ends for the rest of the duration, and the swarm spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest creatures to the best of its ability. As an action, you can dismiss the swarm, causing it to disappear. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

### SCHOOL OF TECHNOMANCY
A new world brings new opportunities as the magical and the mundane fuse into novel patterns. The technomage combines the rising power of magic with a deep understanding of technology. The technomage has a roster of spells that he or she may cast, and in addition gains new powers that meld magic and machinery.

#### TECHNOMANCY SAVANT
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you change your spellbook into a E-book device infused with magic, allowing you to save spells on it in a special format called "spellfiles". The cost or the time you must spend to copy a spell in your E-book device is halved (your choice).

#### MACHINE EMPATHY
Also at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with one of the following tools: engineering kit, hacking kit or mechanic kit, and whenever you make an ability check using the chosen tool, you add twice your proficiency bonus to that roll.

#### PROGRAM SPELL
At 6th level, you can cast a 5th-level spell or lower with a casting time of 1 action while you're touching an electronic device. When you do so, you spend the spell points and the material components (if any), but none of the spell effects occur. Instead, the spell is uploaded into the device for later use. You determine the method of activating the spell, such as typing a specific word, flicking a switch or similar. If the device already have a spell programmed, you cannot use this feature in that device until the previous spell is used or dismissed.

After that, a creature that has an Intelligence score of at least 6 can use an action to activate the spell and cast the programmed spell in the device. The creature must know the method of activation to cast the spell (for example, you can program the haste spell to be casted in a creature when it hits Control-Alt-H in the keyboard). A concentration spell placed in a device cannot be activated if you are concentrating on another spell.

When you program a spell in this way, it must be used within 8 hours. After that time, the magic fades and is wasted. The programmed spell is also lost if the device is destroyed or after you finish a long rest.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### ONLINE CASTING
At 10th level, you can cast certain spells through electronic devices, including cameras, smartphones, tablets, computers, and so on by following this rules.

You can only use this feature to cast spells that target a specific creature or objective.
The range is determined from you to the device and then from the device to your target.
If the spell requires you to see your target, you must be able to see it directly in order to cast it. This also applies if the spell requires the target to see or hear you. If the device have a camera, a screen or speakers, you can try to hack and gain access to these parts for casting your spells.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain your expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### DOWNLOAD SPELL
At 14th level, you can download temporary spellfiles into your E-book device to cast them once.

When you prepare your spells, you can choose two spells of 4th level or lower you know. These spells don't count against the total number of spells you can prepare and you can cast each of them once without expending a spell point until you finish a long rest.

- While you are holding a melee weapon, you can use your reaction to deflect the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d8 + an ability modifier you could use to modify an attack roll with the melee weapon (your choice) + your proficiency bonus.
- The first time you draw a melee weapon in each combat, you gain advantage on your first attack with the weapon, and if the attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to 1d6 + your proficiency bonus.
- You are familiar with the street bushido code. You know the names of other street samurai, you have advantage on Intelligence checks related to the origin and nature of weapons, and you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks to persuade others who follow street bushido.

# Fighting Styles

These additional fighting styles are intended for use with cyberpunk weapons. When any class or subclass chooses a fighting style, the following styles are added to the list of options. The archery fighting style does not affect firearms.

## AKIMBO
Once per turn, when you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can perform the two-weapon fighting attack as part of your Attack action instead of as a bonus action. Additionally, you can reload two firearms as an action or bonus action without a free hand, and you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.

## BARRAGE
When you miss an attack with an automatic weapon, the target takes 2 damage of the weapon’s damage type.

## CLOSE QUARTERS SPECIALIST
While you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature of your size or larger, you have half cover against ranged attacks against you. You do not gain this benefit if you are incapacitated.

## FIREBUG
When you roll damage for a weapon attack against a burning target, you can reroll the weapon’s damage dice and use either total.

## POINT BLANK
When you roll the highest possible number on a weapon damage die for an attack you make with a firearm, you can roll an additional weapon damage die and add it to the result. You can only roll up to two additional damage dice for each attack. You must be within 20 feet of the target of the attack for you to gain this benefit.

## QUICK DRAW
You have advantage on initiative rolls. You can draw or stow a number of weapons equal to your proficiency bonus over the course of your turn. If you have a feature that allows you to draw or stow two weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one, you instead can draw or stow a number of weapons equal to your proficiency bonus plus 1 over the course of your turn.

When you draw a weapon, until the end of your next turn, your first hit with that weapon deals an extra 1d4 damage. Once you have gained this bonus with a weapon, you cannot gain this bonus with the same weapon again until you stow it.

## SNIPER
When you miss an attack with a ranged weapon, you have advantage on your next attack with a ranged weapon against the same target until the end of your next turn.

## SUPPRESSION
The first time you attack a creature with a firearm on your turn, it becomes suppressed until the start of your next turn. If the suppressed target attacks a target other than you or willingly moves 5 feet or more, you can use your reaction to make a weapon attack against it with a firearm.

# Profession System
In Astra Genesis you take on the role of a adventurer trekking across the stars, you are not heroes per se but some people may consider you as such. Astra Genesis do the work that must get done in the galaxy, even if no one wants to talk about it. Bounty hunting, murder for hire, corporate espionage, smuggling, piracy, all of these and more are done by Astra Genesis every moment of every day throughough the known galaxy.

You are one of those Astra Genesis. But who were you *before* you becamse a furious Android Barbarian, or cunning Rogue?

> Game Designer: To be clear. Class only advances by Milestone. The Profession system ***COMPLETELY*** replaces the skill system in 5e. This system has some cross over. Your attribute modifier and your Proficiency modifer do play a role in your skills by giving you a greater margin for error in your rolls. 

Your profession is often separate from your Class. A class represents combat training. Your profession represents what your character did before they took on a role as a Starstrider. 

Put simply: Class comes into play in Ground Combat just following 5e rules. Profession comes into play outside combat more skill based (and also starship combat).

> Game Designer: If something says you get Advantage or Disadvantage you treat as normal and roll the dice twice taking the lwest or highest. If something says you get Expertise such as a Rogue you apply your Proficiency modifier twice as usual.
> 
> Jack of All Trades. Works exactly as it does in 5e. Normally you cannot add your proficiency modifier to skills with 0 Rating. With Jack of All Trades you can add half rounded down minimum 1
> 
> Reliable Talent. Slightly different. Instead of 10 you cannot roll lower than a 6. 

## Step 0: Intro
You will be getting some points to spend as you choose your profession. No skill can be higher than 5.

## Step 1: Your species
You already chose your species. You get a Trait from them in the name of the Species. More on this later. You also get a Trait the name of your class. So your starting Traits are Race/Class.

## Step 2: Backgrounds
Write down whatever label you want for your background. Fold it into your backstory. Were you Orphaned as a child? Put that in there and pick skills that make sense for an Orphaned Child. Work with your gamemaster. The removal of "Background Features" is replaced by the addition of a FEAT.

//TODO Write some Backgrounds

### Background Features
* Pick 1 Skill at +2
* Pick 3 Skills and add +1 to them
* Pick 1 Feat
* Pick 3 Focuses
* Create 2 Values

> Game Designer: What do 5th Edition backgrounds all have in common? No one cares. I have played 5th edition since its inception and DM'd over 2000 hours of it and I have almost never seen someone *use* their background feature. But feats like Lucky? Every day.

## Step 3: Professional Development
Profesional development represents what career your character had (and in some cases may still do). If there is not one that suits your character vision work with your gamemaster to make one. While there is not one for Rimworld Lawkeeper or a Computer Slicer, your gamemaster could definitely assist you in coming up with what that looks like.

- Spend 20 skills on your character
- Pick 3 Focuses
- Create 2 Values
- Gain 1 Contact or 1 Free Language

//TODO Write some Professions

# Traits
Traits are very broad and work as focuses. It covers the fact that you should know your language, history, and background of your species without needing to spend anything.

# Values
A value is a core concept, or cornerstone of your character. In 5e these were Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws. They almost never serve a purpose so they are replaced in Astra Genesis with Values. Written as a guideline about your character they come into play using Adversity later. Values are neutral they can be for you and against you.  

## Invoking
You can invoke a Value to gain 2 Points of Adversity which must be spent immediately. 

## Compels
If the gamemaster uses your Value against you it is called a "Compel" if the gamemaster compels you with a value you gain an Adversity point to save for later (remember Adversity expires at the end of the session) or you can spend a point of Adversity from the pool to resist the compel. If you deny a compel the GM puts that token in their own pool to create complications with. Adveristy from a compel can be spent immediately or added to the party pool.

# Adversity
Adversity represents the fickle nature of the Universe. Some nights it is just not your night with the dice and you really need it to be, other nights the GM is rolling hot and it seems like every roll is a nat 20. The Adversity system allows the party some agency in how the game plays out at any given time.

Adversity is a party pool unless it comes from a Value Invocation. The party is encouraged to work together with it and to spend it. You can never have more than 1 Adversity per player or 6 whichever is higher in the party pool at a time.

## Earning Adversity
Each game begins with no Adversity. You earn Adversity in a couple of ways.

- Rolling a critical miss in combat
- Every extra success on a TN (see Counting Successes)
- Taking a compel from a Gamemaster
- If you find a way to compel an NPC or Monster of its Value you will get an Adversity token (such as threatening a Troll with fire as one of their values is "Afraid of acid and fire")

## Adversity Uses
You can spend Adversity in a number of ways.

- Good Luck! (cost 1). Using Adversity this way allows for the reroll of an Attack, a Skill Check, or any other dice roll.
- Ah another use of Adversity (cost 1). Using an Adversity token in this way allows the players to ask a question to the Gamemaster who will do their best to answer it. A good way to learn Values.
- We planned for this! (cost 1). This allows the players to narratively alter the story, for example if they forgot rope they can remember they did indeed pack rope.
- Too fast. (cost 1). If the player has not acted yet they can spend an adversity to move to the top of the Initiative order.
- With feeling! (cost 2). Using Adversity this way can give an ally or themselves advanatge on a roll and this can be done after the roll so it is not wasted.
- Not So Fast! (cost 2). Using Adversity this way can give an enemy or NPC disadvantage on the roll can be done after the roll so it is not wasted.
- From Death's Door. (cost 2). Spending adversity this way allows a character to instantly gain 1 hitpoint if they are making death saves.
- The Jaws of Defeat. (cost 3). The most powerful use of Adversity. This will maximize the dice being rolled. This cannot cause a Critical Hit but it would cause maximum damage.

## The Gamemaster has Adversity too
The gamemaster also has adversity. Players actually control when the Gamemaster earns this adversity in several ways.

- Refusing a compel puts an Adversity in the GM's pool
- If you roll a critical hit the GM adds an Adversity to their pool

### GM Spends Adversity
How a GM spends Adversity is similar to players. What they do with it is create complications. These are pretty broad but can range from difficult terrain, your weapon ran out of ammo, slip and fall. These are applied when a critical miss is rolled in combat, or when it would be narratively entertaining. You cannot counter a Complication. However, the rule of getting an Adversity token when you roll a critical miss does still apply. Another thing the GM can do is alter the Setting, for example maybe it starts raining, or theres an asteroid belt your sensors did not detect.

| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0      | Untrained, unskilled, lacking in innate aptitude                                                 |
| 1      | Basic training, rudimentary skill, or a raw but undeveloped aptitude.                            |
| 2      | Professional competence, from a combination of training and talent.                              |
| 3      | Experienced and well-trained, or an aptitude developed through study and training.               |
| 4      | Excellence within the field, achievable through dedication and experience.                       |
| 5      | Exceptional, often a combination of intense training, hard-won experience, and natural aptitude. |

## Focuses
Each skill represents a somewhat broad area, a focus allows you to narrow that down and give a specific area that your character has knowledge in. Having an applicapble Focus for a skill check will provide you with a +2 bonus to your skill check, it also allows you to "Take 6" on the skill check when you are not in any danger or high stress treating it as though you rolled a 6 on 2d6 and add all your modifiers (this does not create Adversity). In some cases you may not even be able to attempt a skill check unless you have a focus of a certain type.

## Disciplines
The six disciplines (Phyiscal, Mental, Operational, Observational, Technical, and Social) represent very broad categories of education, training, and natural talent. Your rating in a Discipline is equal to the highest rating in a skill belonging to that Discipline. This comes up when you are trying something that does not fit the standard skills where you can use your natural aptitude for skills in that Discipline to help you carry you a bit. This is also helpful as the disciplines are not tied to a specific attribute and when used the GM will call for an Intellect + Social check or a Strength + Mental check; it just depends on which combination makes the most sense.

## Counting Successes
Sometimes meeting the TN will not be all that is required. In some situations there will be a requirement to exceed a target, or a specified benefit. In ship combat for example extra successes lower Shield Strength. If there is no given benefit for extra successes and no requirement for them. Exceeding the TN will grant bonus Adversity to the pool.

| Roll          | Number of successes |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| =TN           | 0 Extra Successes   |
| 1-5 Above TN  | 1 Extra Success     |
| 6-10 Above TN | 2 Extra Successes   |
| 11+ Above TN  | 3 Extra successes   |

> Example.
>
> If you are given a TN of 10.
>
> You roll a 15 after everything is added up to have netted an extra success.

You can operate, manipulate, and hack into computer systems. If you don’t have physical access to a computer system’s user interface, you must use a hacking kit to access and manipulate the system. .

Computers are set up to give one or more authorized users “root access,” allowing them to access any information or function of the computer as a standard action, with no need for a Computers check. Firewalls can block off specific sections of a computer and grant different users root access to those sections.

The base DC for many of the tasks of the Computers skill is equal to 8 + (2 × the computer’s tier). These DCs may be adjusted by the GM to reflect other circumstances.

- Simple. Write a simple program, access basic information. Hack into primitive computer or system.
- Routine. Write an average program; correlate related information; hack into a personal computer with a Security Level of 10

- Challenging. A complicated task like navigating a nebula, landing at night with no instruments, driving a high speed chase, submerging a submerssible under fire.
- Difficult. Navigating an asteroid belt at speed, landing in a storm, at night, driving a high speed chase through a busy city.
- Virtually Impossible. An immesasurably difficult task. Escaping a black hole. Landing in a hurricane. Navigating underwater at high speed through hair pin turns.

#### Religion
Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.

#### Repair
Most Repair checks are made to fix complex electronic or mechanical devices. The DC is set by the GM. In general, simple repairs have a DC of 10 to 15 and require no more than a few minutes to accomplish. More complex repair work has a DC of 20 or higher and can require an hour or more to complete.

#### Sleight of Hand
Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

#### Science
You are educated in the scientific study of non-living systems, from the tiniest atoms to the largest celestial bodies, and You are educated in the scientific study of living things, from the smallest organisms to the largest biological systems.

#### Stealth
Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard

#### Streetwise
When in a settlement—a village, a town, or a city—make a Streetwise check to find out what’s going on, who the movers and shakers are, where to get what you need (and how to get there), and where not to go.

#### Survival
The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

# Equipment
FROM THE GRAND SUPERMALLS THAT GRACE THE SHOPPING districts of major cities to the electronic vendor stations along the halls of almost every space station, shopping is a part of everyday life in almost every populated area in the galaxy. Goods and services of all types, styles, shapes and sizes can be found almost anywhere either physically or online through the Silrayne Intergalactic Matrix. Massive megacorporations push their ads across all networks. Some manufacturers compete to make the best, most cost effective gear for daily consumption, while others specialize in high-grade luxury items or vehicles. For those who brave the dangers of the deep expanse, the right piece of gear at the right time could mean the difference between life and death.

This chapter covers the different types of common and exotic gear, goods, and services your character may find useful during their exploits.

## Currency
The standard form of galactic currency is the credit (abbreviated as c). It is primarily used as a digital currency, accepted anywhere by online transfer within the core planets. For trade outside the core, however, the credit also has a physical representation: that of a flat metallic disc (a coin) made of pressed meteoric ore harvested from several planets within the galaxy.

For a conversion rate from standard 5e 1 Silver Piece (1sp) = 1 Credit

## Selling Loot
Opportunities abound to find treasure, gear, weapons, armor, and more during your expeditions. Normally, you can sell your gains when you return to a space station or populated settlement, provided that you can find buyers interested in your loot.

Arms, Armor, and Gear: As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in trade. Weapons and armor used by defeated enemies are rarely in good enough condition to sell.

Enhanced Gear and Core Stones: Selling these rare items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a more common item isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest citizens and merchants. Likewise, aside from a few common gear enhancements and stones, you won’t normally come across these items for normal purchase. The value of high-grade tech and sorium core stones is far beyond the standard level of trade and should always be treated as such.

Gems, Jewelry, and Collectibles: These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for money or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a city or a major spaceport.

Trade Goods: On the fringes, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—ore, foodstuffs, gear parts, medicine, and so on—retain their full value in trade and can be used as a form of currency.


# Armor

There are many different styles of armor that vary between different cultures, races, and manufacturers. The different types are classified below. Due to the advancements in weapons manufacturing, armor has become an absolute necessity for anyone traveling beyond the reaches of civilization. Exploring the expanse without at least a shield generator is a risky proposition indeed.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in Starstriders.

**Armor Proficiency.** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t use Magic (Astra).

**Armor Class (AC).** Armor protects its wearer from
attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines
your base Armor Class.

**Heavy Armor.** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**Stealth.** If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Shields.** A shield is made from metal, polymer, energy, or reinforced glass, and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

### Light Armor
Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

- Flight Suit. A layered set of clothing that provides basic protection from harsh climates.
- Armor Jacket. Lined with a protective mesh, this light jacket provides adequate protection while still allowing full movement without restriction.
- Light Trooper. A padded suit with a hardened flexible overlay. Standard issue for most grunts.
- Infiltration Suit. A full body suit made from high grade polymer blends. Expensive but effective.
- Emergency EV Suit. A full body suit with helmet, while wearing it you are protected from the hazards associated with low pressure environments and air toxins. Lasts 8 hours of air.

| Name              | Cost | Weight | AC                | Stealth      |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------ | ----------------- | ------------ |
| Flight Suit       | 50   | 3      | 11 + Dex Modifier | Disadvantage |
| Armor Jacket      | 100  | 5      | 11 + Dex Modifier | -            |
| Light Trooper     | 450  | 10     | 12 + Dex Modifier | Disadvantage |
| Infiltration Suit | 1200 | 5      | 12 + Dex Modifier | -            |
| Emergency EV Suit | 150  | 10     | 11 + Dex Modifier | Disadvantage |


### Medium Armor
Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

Reinforced Mesh: Multiple layers of micro-woven fiber mesh. It most often comes in the form of a vest or torso covering.

Military Jacket. Popular amongst officers and mercs, this jacket’s interior is lined with protective plates and hard padding.

Medium Trooper. Much like the light variant, this is a suit of layered padding with a chest piece and guards made of tempered polymer plating.

Nanoweave Suit. This variant of the trooper armor has been fortified with a coating made of nanocarbons fused over the protective plate.

| Name            | Cost | Weight | AC  | Strength | Stealth      |
| --------------- | ---- | ------ | --- | -------- | ------------ |
| Reinforced Mesh | 100  | 4      | 12  | -        | -            |
| Military Jacket | 500  | 6      | 13  | 13       | -            |
| Medium Trooper  | 500  | 12     | 14  | -        | Disadvantage |
| Nanoweave Suit  | 7500 | 14     | 15  | -        | Disadvantage |

### Heavy Armor
Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

Guardian. Often made of inexpensive material, this bulky armor is a combination of thick padding, rigid metal plates and mesh weaving. It is popular amongst space miners and bunker sentries.

Heavy Trooper. This is a full suit of reinforced mesh underneath a layer of interlocking plates made from hardened composite. Armored gloves and boots are included as well.

Centurion. A suit of heavy trooper armor outfitted with a tempered multi-alloy chest piece with protective shoulder and leg guards. This armor is often limited to high-ranking soldiers and elite infantry.

Fusion Armor. The best in full body protection, this high-grade armor is made from fused meteoric alloys and bolstered with an additional layer of fullerene polymers.

| Name           | Cost  | Weight | AC  | Strength | Stealth      |
| -------------- | ----- | ------ | --- | -------- | ------------ |
| Guardian Armor | 300   | 55     | 14  |          | Disadvantage |
| Heavy Trooper  | 750   | 15     | 16  | Str 13   | Disadvantage |
| Centurion      | 2000  | 55     | 17  | Str 15   | Disadvantage |
| Fusion Armor   | 15000 | 60     | 118 | Str 16   | Disadvantage |

### Shields
Shields come in multiple designs – curved, cornered, composite, energy, etc. All work along the same function, being worn on the off hand and used manually against incoming attacks. The only exception is the Portable Shield Device which is active at all times.

> A portable shield device (PSD) is often worn by long distance travelers. It has a sorium core and is designed to repel high-velocity weapon fire from weapons using the same technology. It can be tailored to fit any wearable hard surfaced item like a bracer, belt, helmet, or the like. While it provides no bonus to AC, it requires no proficiency to use and counts as wearing armor versus weapons that possess the high-velocity property. It also provides a +2 bonus to Burst saves if worn without armor.
> Without a PSD or any armor, a high-velocity weapon deals an additional die of damage with an increased probability of a critical strike (see Weapon Properties).

| Name                         | Cost | Weight | AC      | Stealth |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ------- | ------- |
| Reinforced                   | 100  | 3      | +2      | -       |
| Portable Shield Device (PSD) | 50   | -      | Special | -       |

# Weapons
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a blade or a pistol, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the Astra Genesis, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.

## Weapon Proficiency
Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, batons, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, polearms, and heavy firearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

## Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

- **Adaptable**. A ranged weapon with this property can be used in close quarters combat without suffering a disadvantage on attack rolls.

- **Ammunition**. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing ammunition from a case or cocking a sidearm are all part of the attack (requiring a free hand for a one-handed weapon). If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in this section).

- **Burst Fire**. A weapon with the burst fire property can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 10-foot cube (4 map grid squares) within the weapon’s normal range. A burst is far more uncontrolled than an aimed shot. A burst fire attack can only be taken once per turn and must be within the weapon’s short range. Any creature within the 10-foot cube must make a Dexterity saving throw versus the Burst save DC or suffer the weapon’s damage. A +2 bonus can be added if a PSD is used without armor. Ability modifiers **cannot** be added to the damage roll for a burst fire attack. A weapon can be fired in burst as many times as the number in parenthesis before requiring a full round for the clip to replenish ammunition. This can also be avoided by using an action or bonus action to change out a clip. Changing a clip requires at least one free hand.

*Burst save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (if proficient) + your Dexterity modifier*

- **Energy Burst**. When a successful attack is made with a weapon with this property, a bonus action can be used to fire a burst of energy from its tip or edge. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have their movement reduced by 10 feet until the end of their next turn.

- **Explosive**. Damage from a weapon with this property counts as both fire damage and the damage type listed. Resistances or immunities apply only if the target has them for both damage types. When a target wearing no armor (or PSD) and with no natural armor takes damage from a weapon with this property, the target takes twice the number of dice in damage on the initial damage roll, but not for subsequent damage caused by the same attack. Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

- **Heavy**. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

- **High-Velocity**. This property allows a weapon to fire high velocity bullets in quick succession from a clip modified with a sorium core. There is no need to replenish ammunition unless depleted through Burst Fire. If a weapon with this property is used to attack a target that is wearing no armor (or PSD) and has no natural armor, the target takes an additional die of damage. In addition, the attack scores a critical hit on a 19-20.

- **Light**. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

- **Power Cell**. A weapon with this property uses a Power cell for its ammunition. Reload on a roll of a 1.

- **Recoil**. This numerical value indicates the minimum strength bonus required to handle a high powered recoil weapon without penalty. If this requirement is not met, you may not add your Dexterity modifier to attack or damage rolls. In addition, if the recoil value is higher than your Strength modifier by 2 or more, you are also at disadvantage to all attack rolls made with the weapon.

- **Reload**. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

- **Special**. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).

- **Stun**. This weapon can be set to stun where it deals no damage, however any target who is hit by this weapon must then make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of their next turn. This is common in Energy Weapons.

- **Thrown**. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a combat knife, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the knife has the finesse property.

- **Two-Handed**. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

- **Versatile**. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Using Recoil and Burst Fire
When a weapon has both the burst fire and recoil properties, the recoil property directly affects the burst fire property when making burst fire attacks. If a creature attacking with a firearm cannot add their Dexterity modifier due to recoil, the attacker also loses their Dexterity bonus when calculating their Burst save DC with that weapon. Similarly, if a creature’s attack with a firearm has disadvantage due to recoil, all targets of a burst fire attack with that weapon would have advantage to their burst saves.

This rule, however, is limited to the effects of recoil only, and is not universal. For example, a creature gaining advantage on a weapon attack with a firearm does not automatically give disadvantage to their target’s burst saves.

### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a crowbar, a brick, or a robot arm.

Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a crowbar is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described here.

**Grenade Launcher**. This weapon allows you to make a ranged weapon attack using your Dexterity to launch a grenade instead of making an Athletics check. You must still be proficient in grenades to add your proficiency modifier to the attack roll. The DC versus your attack roll remains the same as listed on the Grenade Range table. The minimum required range is listed in the Launcher Range column.

**Shotgun**. This weapon fires in a 30 ft. cone at one target. Roll to hit the target and use the rules for Burst Fire for anyone else caught within the radius. Firing at 10 feet will score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

**Sniper Rifle**. Using this weapon requires an attack action and a bonus action. The minimum distance for this weapon is 40 ft. If used at a closer distance, the attacker will suffer a disadvantage to the attack roll. Attacks with this weapon score a critical hit on a 19 or 20. If you use this weapon with a weapon stand or while you are prone, the recoil value is reduced to 1. Using this weapon while prone does not give you disadvantage to your attack rolls due to the condition.

### Grenades
A grenade can be thrown with a successful Strength (Athletics) check. If you are proficient with grenades, add your proficiency bonus to the Strength check. If you are proficient in Athletics and grenades, you add double your proficiency modifier to the Strength check. The Grenade Range table provides the DC required to reach the intended range. If the roll is successful, each target in a 15 foot radius must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking the full damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

If the Strength check made to throw the grenade is unsuccessful, the targets will only take half damage on a failed save and no damage on a successful one. In addition, all targets gain advantage to saves versus the grenades’ effects, if any.

There are five common types of grenades.

- **Fragmentation**. Often nicknamed “frag grenades”, these are the most common type of grenade used in military confrontations. When the grenade explodes, shards of shrapnel are propelled at high velocity within the area.

- **EMP**. Short for “electro-magnetic pulse”, these grenades release a pulse of electricity that targets electronics and powered equipment. These grenades do no damage and have no effect on living targets. All mechanical constructs and automatons must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or be considered Impaired until the end of their next turn (see appendix A). In addition, any unshielded computer panel or electronic device not worn by another creature will cease to function until the start of your next turn.

- **Gas**. These grenades release a toxic gas within its area of effect. In addition to damage, each target that fails their saving throw become poisoned (see appendix A)

- **Phosphorous**. This incendiary grenade produces intense heat through an explosive chemical reaction. Targets who fail their saving throw take an additional 1d8 fire damage at the end of each of their turns. To extinguish the flames, the target must spend an action and make a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. In addition, until the end of your next turn, any creature entering the area of effect suffers 1d6 fire damage. 

- **Stun**. This grenade deals no damage, however any target who fails their Dexterity saving throw versus this grenade must then make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of their next turn.

### SPECIAL WEAPONS
Weapons with special rules are described below.

**GRENADE LAUNCHER**

Rather than traditional power cells, the grenade launcher fires grenades. When firing a grenade at long range, or if you don't meet the grenade launchers strength requirement, creatures within the radius of the grenades explosion have advantage on the saving throw. If you lack proficiency in the grenade launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.

**ROCKET LAUNCHER**

Rather than traditional power cells, the rocket launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of rockets. When firing a rocket at long range, or if you dont meet the rocket launchers strength requirement, creatures within the radius of the rockets explosion have advantage on the saving throw.

## Gear Descriptions
- Antitoxin. A creature that drinks or is injected with this liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to automatons or constructs.

- Binoculars (Micro). These mini-binoculars extend your visual range. You can see up to a distance of 10 times the range of your normal vision. You cannot see any objects within 15 feet and are at disadvantage to all Wisdom (Perception) checks made to notice anything within 15 feet of you.

- Binoculars (Rangefinding). These are slightly larger and function the same as micro binoculars. These, however, also provide a readout of exact distance between you and a chosen point of focus. You also receive advantage to any Intelligence (Investigation) rolls made when searching for any details regarding your point or object of focus.

- Bio-suit. This bulky outfit is often used whenever walking into zones deemed to be biohazards. The suit has a built in air filtration unit and is chemically sealed. While wearing this suit, you are immune to poison and disease, however, your movement rate is halved and you cannot take reactions.

- Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a box of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.

- Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

- Climber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes spikes, interlocking hooks, boot tips, mag-gloves, and a climbing harness.

# FIREARM ACCESSORIES
No firearm would be complete without proper accessorization. What better way to make an assault rifle your own than to add a razor sharp bayonet, an under-barrel flamethrower, a guncam to record your kills, and gold plating to top it off. Now you’re killing with class!

You can use a firearm with a number of accessories installed up to your proficiency bonus. If you attack with a firearm that has a number of accessories that exceeds your proficiency bonus, the attack is made with disadvantage.

Firearm accessories can be purchased and installed from most gun stores and weapon merchants. You may be able to construct and install your own accessories with tinker’s tools. Firearm addons must be purchased for a specific type of firearm. For example, you cannot purchase a pistol silencer and then attach it to an assault rifle.

> MULTIPLE MODIFICATIONS
> You cannot apply a modification or accessory to a firearm, weapon, armor, or vehicle if it already has it installed.

## AUTO-LOADER
This advanced reload system is partially attached to your body, clothing, or armor, and will automatically reload the weapon if it is stowed in your inventory (not being held in your hands) at the start of your turn.

## BAYONET
The weapon also functions as a dagger for melee attack purposes, including opportunity attacks. You must use two hands when you make an attack with this weapon.

## DEEP MAGAZINE.
The number of attacks that can be made with this weapon before it must be reloaded is increased by 50% (rounded down).

## EASY BREAKDOWN
This weapon can be broken into several parts or reconstructed from its parts over the course of a minute. While dismantled, this weapon can't be used to make an attack, but it can be stored in half the usual space and ability checks made to conceal the weapon are made with advantage.

## ELECTRO SHOCKER
This weapon will electrocute unregistered users. The creature holding the weapon will take 1d8 lightning damage for every attack they make with the weapon.

## FIREARM TRIPOD
A temporary standing mount for larger firearms. It can be used with any heavy, two-handed weapon that has the Recoil property. Setting up or dismantling the tripod takes 1 minute. A tripod-mounted weapon’s recoil value is reduced by 2. While wielding the weapon, your speed is 0 and you have disadvantage to Dexterity saving throws and burst saves. You can spend an action to detach the weapon from the tripod mount.


## FLASHLIGHT
When activated, this flashlight casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet.

## GOLD PLATED
Coats the exterior of the weapon with a thin layer of gold. Wielding this causes you to look swag as fuck.

## GUNCAM
When activated, this camera records whatever the weapon is pointed at.

## LASER SIGHT
This attachment fits onto any ranged weapon with the ammunition property. At the start of your turn, you can use a bonus action to gain advantage on your first attack roll against a target you can see within your weapon’s normal range. You can’t use this feature against targets benefitting from cover or in a heavily obscured area.

## LIGHTWEIGHT DESIGN
This weapon weighs half its normal weight. Replaces the weapon’s metal and wooden parts with plasteel, a tempered plastic. The weapon no longer sets off metal detectors and it is no longer affected by metal targeting effects.

If this weapon has the heavy property, you can choose to ignore it when you make an attack with this weapon.

## SELF-DESTRUCT
This weapon will explode if anyone other than the registered user attempts to operate it. The creature holding the weapon must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 piercing and 2d8 thunder damage.

## SILENCER
As an action you can attach the silencer to any firearm that does not have the scatter, blast, or massive properties. You can also remove the silencer as an action. This significantly muffles the sound of gunshots, so that the shot can only be heard from half the weapon’s normal range. While the silencer is attached, a ranged weapon attack with the weapon automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range.

## SLING
When you drop a firearm, you can instead choose to have it hang by its sling to your body. Only one firearm can hang from a sling at once.

## SUPERCAVITATION
Your weapon creates a bubble of gas just large enough to encompass a projectile when it fires underwater, greatly reducing the skin friction drag and enabling high speeds. This grants a firearm the marine property.


# Vehicles
Vehicles can help you travel quickly as well as carry large amounts of gear that would otherwise slow you down. Vehicles table shows each vehicle’s speed and base carrying capacity.

## Vehicle Types and Proficiency
There are four overall types of vehicles in Astra Genesis.

Putting points into Pilot will affect your ability to pilot all of these vehicle types. All vehicles use a similar control schema in Astra Genesis. To ride a beast requires Survival.

- Beast: Though not as common as machine craft, there are various species of beasts that may serve as mounts throughout the galaxy.
- Planetary: This covers all ground and hovercraft as well as low flying cars and bikes that are common in the larger cities.
- Space: Includes all spacecraft from fighters to shuttles to large cruisers. Details for spacecraft and starships are detailed later
- Watercraft: This covers any vehicle that travels upon the surface or underwater.

## Spell Descriptions

### ADVANCED HAYWIRE
5th-level evocation

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a frayed universal cable)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- Classes: Artificer, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard
You cause machines to undergo catastrophic failure. Choose a point you can see within range. The vehicles, lights, speakers, and wires in a 60-foot cube centered on that point begin to malfunction dangerously until the spell ends.

Vehicles. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a vehicle in the area to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you can cause the vehicle to move up to its movement speed in a straight line, but not outside the cube. On a successful save, the vehicle is unaffected.

Lights. At the end of each of your turns, you can choose one light source in the area. Creatures within 10 feet of the light source that can see it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn.

Speakers. You are aware of all speakers in the spell’s area. At the start of each of your turns, you can choose one speaker or a machine with a speaker, such as a walkie talkie or smartphone, in the cube. Each creature in a 15-foot cone from the speaker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 thunder damage and be deafened for 1 minute.

Wires. Wires tear themselves out of the ground, floor, and walls and begin sparking violently. When a creature moves into or within the area, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 lightning damage for every 5 feet it travels until the start of its next turn.

### ARCANE GRAFFITI
Conjuration cantrip

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: 1 hour
This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or a short message, which can be no larger than 2 feet tall and consist of no more than six words, on a nonliving creature or object. The writing can be visible or invisible. An arcane graffiti spell enables you to etch the words upon any substance (even stone or metal) without harming the material upon which the mark is placed. If invisible graffiti is made, the casting of any spell within 30 feet causes the words to become visible for 5 rounds.

### AWAKEN VEHICLE
6th-level transmutation

- Casting Time: 8 hours
- Range: Touch
- Components: V S M (holy motor oil worth at least 150,000₵, which the spell consumes)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Cleric, Druid, Bard
After spending the casting time tracing blessed motor oil in magical roadways along the exterior of the vehicle, you touch a huge or smaller vehicle. The vehicle becomes a sentient vehicle, and gains an Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. The vehicle gains senses similar to a human’s.

The awakened vehicle is charmed by you for 30 days or until you and your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened vehicle chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the vehicle can be of any size.

### BOOMERANG SHOT
Cantrip transmutation

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Firearm range
- Components: V M (a ranged weapon)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon against one target within the weapon’s range. If the attack misses the projectile loops around, and you can use your reaction to make the attack again at the same target, ignoring advantage, disadvantage, and cover, and without consuming additional ammunition. If the attack misses a second time, roll your weapon’s damage dice. You take the rolled amount as damage of the weapon’s damage type.

The attack deals an extra 1d8 damage when you reach 5th level (1d8), 11th level (2d8), and 17th level (3d8).

### BURGLAR'S BUDDY
2nd-level illusion (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Self (10-foot radius)
- Components: V, S, M (a camera lens cover)
- Duration: 1 minute
You create a magical area around you, suppressing all mechanical or electronic intrusion alarms and alarms sensors in the area. Burglar alarms or other intrusion alarms within the affected area simply fail to function; sensors for intrusion alarm systems (such as motion detectors, IR detectors, pressure sensors, electric eyes, and so forth) also fail to function, sending no signal to monitoring stations. Video surveillance devices stop sending whatever the image they were photographing the moment when the spell was cast.

### CAMOUFLAGE VEHICLE
3rd-level illusion

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V S M (an unpaid parking ticket)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
- Classes: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Wizard
A vehicle you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Creatures are also invisible while riding the vehicle. While you are within 60 feet of the vehicle, you can speak a command word to end the spell. The spell ends when the vehicle or any creature inside attacks, casts a spell, or takes damage.

### CHAOS SHOT
2nd-level evocation

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Firearm range
- Components: V M (a ranged weapon)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Artificer, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged attack with a weapon against a creature or vehicle within range. If you hit, your ammunition erupts with chaotic magical energy. Roll a d8. The number rolled on the d8 determines the damage type for all attacks made as part of this spell, as shown below.

| D8  | DAMAGE TYPE |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1   | Acid        |
| 2   | Cold        |
| 3   | Fire        |
| 4   | Force       |
| 5   | Lightning   |
| 6   | Poison      |
| 7   | Psychic     |
| 8   | Thunder     |

Additionally, on a hit the shot must redirect itself from the target to a different creature or vehicle of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, which could cause the shot to redirect again, targeting up to a maximum of 5 targets. A target can be targeted only once per turn by these attacks.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, each target of this spell takes an additional 1d8 damage for each slot level above 2nd.

### COMMANDEER VEHICLE
7th-level enchantment

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: V S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- Classes: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
You attempt to commandeer a vehicle that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be controlled by you. If it currently has a driver, it has advantage on the saving throw.

 While the vehicle is commandeered, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required). The vehicle becomes sentient and can perform its own actions to obey your commands. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Drive in that direction,” “Run over that creature,” or “Crash into that wall.” If the vehicle completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it does nothing.

A creature at the vehicle’s controls can attempt to wrench control away from you, causing the vehicle to make a new Constitution saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 9th level, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

### CONJURE TURRET
2nd-level conjuration (ritual)

- Casting Time: 1 bonus action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V S M (a shell casing)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
- Classes: Artificer, Cleric, Paladin, Ranger

An assault cannon
A gatling gun
A rocket launcher
This magic weapon can be used normally as a mounted massive weapon, except that it cannot be unmounted, and you can reload it with conjured magical ammunition as a bonus action while you are within 60 feet of it. The ammunition disappears when the spell ends. You are proficient with this weapon. Creatures can move freely through its space.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 force damage when it hits for every two slot levels above the 2nd. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can use your bonus action to attack twice with this weapon using your spellcasting modifier while you are within 60 feet of it.

### CONTRACT
3rd-level enchantment (ritual)

- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: 10 feet
- Components: V S M (a written, typed, or digital contract)
- Duration: Special
- Classes: Artificer, Bard, Warlock, Wizard
When you cast this spell, you bind the souls of two parties to a contract, forcing them to adhere to it or suffer dire penalties. Choose two willing creatures within range. They must verbally agree to the terms of the contract used as the material component for the spell, and must not be suffering from the charmed condition. The contract also has a length which determines the duration of the spell, up to 1 year.

When you cast this spell, choose agony, death, or misfortune as the penalty for violating the contract, which the targeted creatures are aware of before agreeing to the terms. At the DM's discretion, you may choose an alternative effect for violating the contract, but it should be no more powerful than those described below.

Once both creatures have agreed to the contract, the spell takes effect. If either creature is ever in violation of the terms of the contract, down to the letter, it suffers the effects of the chosen penalty. The penalty is in effect until the creature is in accordance with the terms of the contract.

Agony. Every day at dawn, the creature takes 6d6 psychic damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, the creature falls unconscious and is stable.

Death. Every day at dawn, the creature takes 1d6 necrotic damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

Misfortune. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma and Wisdom saving throws. Additionally, when the creature rolls a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you instead treat the roll as if it were a 1.

The spell can be ended early if both creatures verbally agree to end it while within 10 feet of each other, so long as each creature is not suffering from the charmed condition. A remove curse spell also ends this spell if it is cast using a spell slot level equal to or higher than the spell slot used to cast this spell. If the spell is ended early, both creatures are aware of it.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

### DATAREAD
2nd-level divination (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You run your finger over any machine-readable data source (a barcode, a computer disk, a USB drive, or any similar record) to understand the content of the data. You experience the data as it would normally be experienced through an appropriate machine. For example, if reading a USB with music, you hear the music in your head. If reading a word processor file, you visualize and read an image of the page. If reading a barcode, you see the serial number, pricing information, or other barcoded data.

The amount of time required to experience the data is the same as that required to read it by conventional means. You can normally read 2 pages of documents in 1 minute. This spell does not decode encrypted data. Without the encryption code, an encrypted document or file appears as a seemingly random string of characters. If you know the encryption code, however, you can read encrypted data normally with this spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for 10 minutes. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for 1 hour.

### DECOMPOSE
2nd-level necromancy

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V S M (a pinch of grave dirt)
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
This spell rapidly causes the body to decay. There are two possible uses for the spell, depending on whether the target is a living or dead creature.

If you cast this spell targeting a living creature, make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 necrotic damage.

If you cast this spell targeting a dead creature, the body rapidly decays, increasing the amount of time the creature has been dead by 10 days for the purposes of the time limit on raising the target from the dead. For example, a dead creature targeted by this spell could not be returned to life by the raise dead spell.


 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell targeting a living creature using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

If you cast this spell targeting a dead creature using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the amount of time the creature has been dead increases to 100 years. If you cast this spell targeting a dead creature using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the amount of time the creature has been dead increases to 200 years.

> DM TIP: STAYING DEAD
In a cyberpunk world that has high amounts of magic, it may be difficult for the player characters to keep a creature dead. After all, if resurrection magic exists, a corporation would undoubtedly have the resources to pay for it, and the wealthy could have death insurance contracts that include attempts to raise the contract holder from the dead. What are are the player characters to do? There are numerous options, including dissolving it in acid, or burning it to ashes. However, with the resurrection spell, a VIP could still be returned to life, though at great expense. The player characters could also use the decompose spell to rapidly age the body out of easy raising, or make it completely impossible to resurrect with higher levels of the spell.

### DEGAUSS
1st-level transmutation (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: Touch
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous
By touching a single device that contains electronic files, such as a computer, external hard drive, USB flash drive, or magnetic disk, you erase all files on that device. The device is rendered empty of data.

## ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE
3rd-level evocation (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S
- Duration: Instantaneous
When you cast this spell, you send a powerful burst of energy that ruins electronic circuitry in a 20-foot cube. Any computer, telephone, television, or other device with a computer processor inside ceases to function immediately, and the contents of hard drives and other storage media are scrambled.

The electromagnetic pulse affects only devices with extensive circuitry, not everything that uses electricity. Ordinarily the lights stay on, although their electronic switches might not function. Automobiles continue to run, although their engines will run more roughly without electronic guidance. Cars with an electronic ignition system won't start after the spell.

Devices affected by this spell can be fixed using an engineering kit.

### FIND RIDE
2nd-level conjuration

- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V S
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Classes: Paladin
You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a sentient motorcycle, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the motorcycle can move and act independently. It has the statistics of a motorcycle, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a construct. Additionally, the motorcycle’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma become 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak. The vehicle has senses similar to a human’s.

Your motorcycle serves you as a vehicle, both in and out of combat, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. You are considered proficient with land vehicles while driving your summoned motorcycle, if you were not already. While driving your motorcycle, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your motorcycle.

When the motorcycle drops to 0 hit points, it explodes, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your motorcycle at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same motorcycle, restored to its hit point maximum.

While your motorcycle is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.

You can't have more than one motorcycle bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the motorcycle from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can summon a sports motorcycle. If you use a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can summon a warcycle with a flying speed of 140 feet.

### FIND THE ROAD
4th-level transmutation

- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: Touch
- Components: V S M (a bit of road tar)
- Duration: 8 hours
- Classes: Druid, Ranger
Touch one land vehicle. For the duration, as the vehicle travels, a magical paved road emerges from the ground or water, pushing aside natural terrain, as well as trees under 5 feet in width.


 The shape of the terrain is not altered, so rock walls, cliffs, and mountains are unaffected. After the vehicle passes, the road vanishes behind it, and the terrain regains its original form.

The vehicle can travel no faster than a rate of 80 feet per round in combat or 40 miles per hour out of combat on this road.

### HAYWIRE
Transmutation cantrip (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 30 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a small magnet)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This cantrip causes a single device to behave randomly and erratically, defying any attempts to bring it under control. Cash registers display random prices and open their money drawers repeatedly. Escalators surge forward, then reverse themselves. Automatic teller machines flash random patrons' account balances on the screen as they spew forth receipts (not money, though).

It's impossible to describe the exact effects of haywire on every modern device. In general, a machine subject to haywire functions as if someone were pressing random buttons or otherwise manipulating it randomly.

Turning off a device subject to a haywire spell doesn't work, because the spell disables the “off” switch. Cutting off the power supply (by unplugging it, for example) disables the device 1d4 rounds later, ending the spell.

This cantrip doesn't disable the devices (for example, a camera might get a static effect but it will continue recording, and a door with an electronic lock might not be openable while is under the effects of this cantrip)

### INSTANT CONNECTIVITY
5th-level conjuration (technomagic)

- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 10 feet
- Components: V, S, M (a device connected to internet worth at least 100)
- Duration: Instantaneous
With the aid of instant messaging software, you physically transport the subject or subjects from one place to another. If several willing creatures link hands in a circle, up to eight creatures can be affected by the spell at the same time.

At least one of the creatures affected must be touching a computer with Internet connection. The targets must be sent to a specific computer that is currently active online. Instant connectivity causes the targets to appear in the room from which the receiving device is, automatically gaining surprise on anyone else in that room.

You must have seen the receiving device for at least 1 minute from 5 feet or less to be able to target that device.

If any of the devices have some kind of security (or if the device is in a secure network), the spell cannot be casted until the security is disabled (for more information about disabling security, read the "Using Electronic Devices" section).

### JAM SIGNALS

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

### MACHINE INVISIBILITY

Immediately after, you can redirect the projectile to make a ranged weapon attack against a target you can see from the projectile’s location, as if you had made the attack with the weapon. You do not have advantage on the attack roll due to the target not being able to see you.

The attack deals an extra 1d8 damage when you reach 5th level (1d8), 11th level (2d8), and 17th level (3d8).

# Starship Combat

## Action Economy
Ships can take up to 2 actions per round and 1 Bonus Action.

However, only 1 person can use the Tactical System, and 1 person can use the Helm system. It takes a Move (or a Dash) action to exectute a ship action.

## Protection/Threshold
Protection comes from Shields. As does threshold.

As a ship takes damage its shields will loose Strength for ever extra success that the enemy hits them with over their Protection rating.

| Strength | Effect                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 10       | Full strength                              |
| 9        | -1 Protection                              |
| 8        |                                            |
| 7        | -1 Protection                              |
| 6        |                                            |
| 5        | -1 Threshold                               |
| 4        |                                            |
| 3        | -1 Threshold                               |
| 2        | -1 Threshold                               |
| 1        | -1 Threshold                               |
| 0        | SHields down. Protection is 5 no Threshold |

## Ranges
Range is very abstract in space combat. It has 5 range bands.

Close -> Short -> Medium -> Long -> Extended

Close Range is close enough to dock or land smallcraft.

Ships move further or nearer one another with Helm Actions. The GM decides what range ships are at when combat begins.

### Optimal Range
All weapons have an Optimal Range.

Projectile/Energy Weapons have an Optimum Range of Short. They are at disadvantage to hit at Medium and Close Range. These weapons typically cannot damage anything further than medium range.

Missile Weapons and Torpedoes have an Optimum Range of Long. They are at disadvantage to hit at Extended, Medium, and Short range. Missile weapons cannot damage targets at Close range.

## Initiative
The GM declares the range of the engagement and the player rolls 2d6+Ships sensor rating for that range. Highest goes first and then the next and so forth.

## Damage
Damage is predetermined by offensive power. 

If the targets protection is hit, the Threshold is taken away from the damage, and then anything that remains left over is applied to the ships Structure.

Every 5 points of Structure damage causes a Breach. Roll on the Breach Chart and then reduce that systems effectiveness down one and they will suffer the next ranks penalties.

### Breach Chart
| Dice Roll | System       |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 1         | Life Support |
| 2         | Operations   |
| 3-6       | Propulsion   |
| 7-9       | Sensors      |
| 10-15     | No System    |
| 16-17     | Shields      |
