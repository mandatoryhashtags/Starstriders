# Adversity (optional)
Adversity represents the fickle nature of the Universe. Some nights it is just not your night with the dice and you really need it to be, other nights the GM is rolling hot and it seems like every roll is a nat 20. The Adversity system allows the party some agency in how the game plays out at any given time.

Adversity is a party pool unless it comes from a Value Invocation. The party is encouraged to work together with it and to spend it. You can never have more than 1 Adversity per player or 6 whichever is higher in the party pool at a time.

## Earning Adversity
Each game begins with no Adversity. You earn Adversity in a couple of ways.

- Rolling a critical miss in combat
- Every extra success on a TN (see Counting Successes)
- Taking a compel from a Gamemaster
- If you find a way to compel an NPC or Monster of its Value you will get an Adversity token (such as threatening a Troll with fire as one of their values is "Afraid of acid and fire")

## Adversity Uses
You can spend Adversity in a number of ways.

- Good Luck! (cost 1). Using Adversity this way allows for the reroll of an Attack, a Skill Check, or any other dice roll.
- Ah another use of Adversity (cost 1). Using an Adversity token in this way allows the players to ask a question to the Gamemaster who will do their best to answer it. A good way to learn Values.
- We planned for this! (cost 1). This allows the players to narratively alter the story, for example if they forgot rope they can remember they did indeed pack rope.
- Too fast. (cost 1). If the player has not acted yet they can spend an adversity to move to the top of the Initiative order.
- With feeling! (cost 2). Using Adversity this way can give an ally or themselves advanatge on a roll and this can be done after the roll so it is not wasted.
- Not So Fast! (cost 2). Using Adversity this way can give an enemy or NPC disadvantage on the roll can be done after the roll so it is not wasted.
- From Death's Door. (cost 2). Spending adversity this way allows a character to instantly gain 1 hitpoint if they are making death saves.
- The Jaws of Defeat. (cost 3). The most powerful use of Adversity. This will maximize the dice being rolled. This cannot cause a Critical Hit but it would cause maximum damage.

## The Gamemaster has Adversity too
The gamemaster also has adversity. Players actually control when the Gamemaster earns this adversity in several ways.

- Refusing a compel puts an Adversity in the GM's pool
- If you roll a critical hit the GM adds an Adversity to their pool

### GM Spends Adversity
How a GM spends Adversity is similar to players. What they do with it is create complications. These are pretty broad but can range from difficult terrain, your weapon ran out of ammo, slip and fall. These are applied when a critical miss is rolled in combat, or when it would be narratively entertaining. You cannot counter a Complication. However, the rule of getting an Adversity token when you roll a critical miss does still apply. Another thing the GM can do is alter the Setting, for example maybe it starts raining, or theres an asteroid belt your sensors did not detect.
