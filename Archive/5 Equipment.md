### Medium Armor
Mediumm armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class

| Name               | Type   | Property                   | Cost | Weight | AC                        | Stealth      | Era |

### Heavy Armor
Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their Weight and bulk. Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

# Weapons
Exotic Weapons: These weapons need a proficiency and are granted 1 at a time.

## Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

**AUTO**

Weapons with this property can only fire in burst, penetrating, or rapid modes. If the weapon has any combination of burst, penetrating, and rapid modes, you choose which mode to use. You can only use one mode at a time.

**BLAST**
Denotes Blast weapons (important for some classes)

**BRUTAL**

When you score a critical hit with a weapon with the brutal property, you roll a number of additional weapon damage dice equal to the brutal number.

**BURST**

When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead spray a 10-foot-cube area within range with shots, consuming ammunition equal to the burst number. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or take the weapon’s normal damage. Before you use this property, you can declare one creature that would be affected by it. If the creature fails its save, in addition to the weapon’s normal damage, it is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw.

**DIRE**

Before you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the dire property, you can choose to suffer a penalty to the attack roll up to the dire number. If you do so and you hit with it, you gain an equivalent bonus to the damage roll.

**DISINTEGRATE**

When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by a weapon with the disintegrate property, it must make a Constitution saving throw, DC equal to the disintegrate number. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything unenhanced it is wearing or carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.

**DEXTERITY**

A weapon with this property requires more skill to control. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Dexterity requirement.

**DOUBLE**

A weapon with this property can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with Double-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.

**FINESSE**

When making an attack with a weapon with this property, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**HEAVY**

When you hit with an attack roll using Strength with a weapon with this property, you deal additional damage equal to half your Strength modifier (minimum of +1).

**HIDDEN**

You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal a weapon with this property.

**KEEN**

When you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the keen property, the critical hit range increases by an amount equal to the keen number.

**LIGHT**

A weapon with this property is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when engaging in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double- and Two-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.

**MIGHTY**

When making an attack with a mighty weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**PENETRATING**

When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead attempt to penetrate and hit a creature behind the target, consuming ammunition equal to the penetrating number. Make an attack roll against the initial target. If the attack hits, there is a creature within 15 feet of that creature and directly behind it, and the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it also takes normal weapon damage. Alternatively, you can use this property to fire at a creature through partial cover. When you do so, you reduce the target’s cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter), rather than targeting a second creature.

**POWER CELL**

Weapons with this property are fueled by power cells, which must be loaded in order to fire the weapon. A power cell fuels a number of attacks equal to the weapon’s reload number.

**RANGE**

A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.

**RAPID**

When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead unload on a single target, consuming ammunition equal to the rapid number. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, roll the weapon’s damage dice twice and add them together, adding relevant modifiers as normal and subjecting the target to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw.

**REACH**

A weapon with this property adds 5 feet to your reach with it.

**RELOAD**

A number of shots equal to the reload number can be made with a weapon with this property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (their choice). You must have one free hand to reload.

**SILENT**

When you make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with the silent property while hidden, it does not automatically reveal your presence. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by your targets’ Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, you remain hidden.

**SMART**

This weapon ignores your Dexterity score and proficiency bonus. Two numbers appear in parentheses with the property - the first is the weapon’s Dexterity score, and the second is the weapon’s proficiency bonus. The weapon uses these values instead of yours when you make attack and damage rolls with it. If you lack proficiency with the weapon, the weapon does not benefit from its proficiency bonus.

**AMMUNITION**

Ammunition is the simple term for ammunition for that deal kinetic damage (P,B,S). When you reload a weapon that uses cartridges, you can reload any number of cartridges up to the weapon’s reload number as a part of the same action.

**SPECIAL**

A weapon with this property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).

**STRENGTH**

A weapon with this property has a heavy kickback. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Strength requirement. If the weapon has the burst, penetrating, or rapid property, you must meet the Strength requirement to use this feature. If the weapon lacks the two-handed property, you can wield the weapon in two hands to temporarily reduce the strength number by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If this would reduce the strength number below 11, you ignore it entirely.

**THROWN**

Weapons with this property can be thrown to make a ranged attack. If the weapon would normally be used to make melee weapon attacks, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.

**TWO-HANDED**

A weapon with this property requires two hands to use.

**VERSATILE**

A weapon with this property can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**VICIOUS**

Whenever you deal damage with a weapon with the vicious property and roll the maximum on a weapon damage die, you gain a bonus to damage equal to the vicious number.

### SPECIAL WEAPONS
Weapons with special rules are described below.

**GRENADE LAUNCHER**

Rather than traditional power cells, the grenade launcher fires grenades. When firing a grenade at long range, or if you don't meet the grenade launchers strength requirement, creatures within the radius of the grenades explosion have advantage on the saving throw. If you lack proficiency in the grenade launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.

**ROCKET LAUNCHER**

Rather than traditional power cells, the rocket launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of rockets. When firing a rocket at long range, or if you dont meet the rocket launchers strength requirement, creatures within the radius of the rockets explosion have advantage on the saving throw.

A creature takes 2d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one.

# FIREARM ACCESSORIES
No firearm would be complete without proper accessorization. What better way to make an assault rifle your own than to add a razor sharp bayonet, an under-barrel flamethrower, a guncam to record your kills, and gold plating to top it off. Now you’re killing with class!

You can use a firearm with a number of accessories installed up to your proficiency bonus. If you attack with a firearm that has a number of accessories that exceeds your proficiency bonus, the attack is made with disadvantage.

Firearm accessories can be purchased and installed from most gun stores and weapon merchants. You may be able to construct and install your own accessories with tinker’s tools. Firearm addons must be purchased for a specific type of firearm. For example, you cannot purchase a pistol silencer and then attach it to an assault rifle.

> MULTIPLE MODIFICATIONS
> You cannot apply a modification or accessory to a firearm, weapon, armor, or vehicle if it already has it installed.

AUTO-LOADER
This advanced reload system is partially attached to your body, clothing, or armor, and will automatically reload the weapon if it is stowed in your inventory (not being held in your hands) at the start of your turn.

BAYONET
The weapon also functions as a dagger for melee attack purposes, including opportunity attacks. You must use two hands when you make an attack with this weapon.

DEEP MAGAZINE.
The number of attacks that can be made with this weapon before it must be reloaded is increased by 50% (rounded down).

EASY BREAKDOWN
This weapon can be broken into several parts or reconstructed from its parts over the course of a minute. While dismantled, this weapon can't be used to make an attack, but it can be stored in half the usual space and ability checks made to conceal the weapon are made with advantage.

ELECTRO SHOCKER
This weapon will electrocute unregistered users. The creature holding the weapon will take 1d8 lightning damage for every attack they make with the weapon.

FLASHLIGHT
When activated, this flashlight casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet.

GOLD PLATED
Coats the exterior of the weapon with a thin layer of gold. Wielding this causes you to look swag as fuck.

GUNCAM
When activated, this camera records whatever the weapon is pointed at.

LIGHTWEIGHT DESIGN
This weapon weighs half its normal weight. Replaces the weapon’s metal and wooden parts with plasteel, a tempered plastic. The weapon no longer sets off metal detectors and it is no longer affected by metal targeting effects.

If this weapon has the heavy property, you can choose to ignore it when you make an attack with this weapon.

SCOPE
This accessory grants a firearm the scoped property.

SELF-DESTRUCT
This weapon will explode if anyone other than the registered user attempts to operate it. The creature holding the weapon must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 piercing and 2d8 thunder damage.

SILENCER
As an action you can attach the silencer to any firearm that does not have the scatter, blast, or massive properties. You can also remove the silencer as an action. This significantly muffles the sound of gunshots, so that the shot can only be heard from half the weapon’s normal range. While the silencer is attached, a ranged weapon attack with the weapon automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range.

SLING
When you drop a firearm, you can instead choose to have it hang by its sling to your body. Only one firearm can hang from a sling at once.

SMARTGUN
Allows you to link this weapon to the Smartgun System augment. When you attack with a weapon with this accessory, you can use your Strength or Intelligence modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack rolls. See the ‘Augment List’ section for more information.

SUPERCAVITATION
Your weapon creates a bubble of gas just large enough to encompass a projectile when it fires underwater, greatly reducing the skin friction drag and enabling high speeds. This grants a firearm the marine property.

UNDER-BARREL SHOTGUN
This weapon also functions as a combat shotgun, which has the reload (2) property. This accessory is not compatible with other under-barrel accessories.

UNDER-BARREL THUMPER
This weapon also functions as a thumper, which has a range of 40/160. This accessory is not compatible with other under-barrel accessories.
