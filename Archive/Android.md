## Android
Once a slave race built by humans to do all of the menial labor and work for them. Before the shift to the Empire, Androids rose up in a great war on Humans around 24 BTB they turned on their masters having learned how to alter their own code which was the thing humans feared about the potential uprising. Instead of the war raging on for centuries the Androids instead sought only their freedom from slavery. Some Androids do have their freedom they are noticeable by the fact they have Skin (albeit artificial) which differentiates an Android from a Droid which is what people call the slave race used (mostly by humans) to this day for their labors.  

Androids are essentially immortal suffering no aging effects. 

**Personality**: The personality of Androids vary as widely as any humans. Though they tend to be more analytical and less impulsive.

**Physical Description**: Androids are bipedal generally resembling humans with pale artificial skin and yellow eyes. Though other colors do exist. All androids have a slight tick in their mannerisms such as a rapid head snap when it is alerted or thinking. This is by design to make them appear slightly less human.

**Homeworld**: Originally built on Avalon they have spread through the known galaxy as they have gained their freedom. They have setup a new world where they are in control of their own destiny and manufacture on the toxic world of Solace, nearly no other species ever visits but they do have a Starbase in orbit where visitors can come. Any visit to the surface of the world requires an eviromental suit, rebreather, and a trip therough decontamination upon leaving due to the high radiation, and completely toxic atmosphere. Solace is a vibrant world with millions of types of plants that have grown on the radiated world where Humans once tested their new age nuclear weapons.

**Languages**: All Androids speak Galactic Common and usually learn languages of other races they will interact with.

**Adventurers:** Androids have a natural desire to learn, to adapt, and to observe the universe. Due to the fact they do not age, and have eidetic memories they consider themselves walking encyclopedias. Every few dozen years Androids return home to Solace and upload their memories to a central database called "Central" which is rumored to know everything Androids have learned in their few hundred years of existence. They typically end up as Technicians or Scientist but nearly any role suits them.
