## Difficulty Steps
Occasionally you will see something like a Situation Trait state that Difficulties are increased by X or something is a Difficulty X. Like Darkness 2, means that regardless of how difficult something is it increases the difficulty by 2 steps. So a Easy TN 5 task becomes a Challenging TN 15 task.

| Difficulty | Suggested TN               | Step | New | Base 20 always hit 20 |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ---- | --- |
| 0          | No Test Needed             | -    | 0   |
| 5          | Easy                       | 0    | 10  |
| 10         | Standard                   | 1    | 15  |
| 15         | Challenging                | 2    | 20  |
| 20         | Difficult                  | 3    | 25  |
| 25         | Virtually Impossible       | 4    | 30  |
| 30         | Supremely Difficult        | 5    | 35  |
| 35         | Supernatually Difficult    | 6    | 40  |
| 40         | Heroically Difficult       | 7    | 45  |
| 45         | This is likely a bad idea  | 8    | 50  |
| 50         | Should not be possible     | 9    | 55  |
| 55         | Divine Intervention needed | 10   | 60  |
| 60         | Is impossible              | -    | 65  |

A good use of Compels is to crease the difficulty of something by a Step.
