# Profession System
In Astra Genesis you take on the role of a adventurer trekking across the stars, you are not heroes per se but some people may consider you as such. Astra Genesis do the work that must get done in the galaxy, even if no one wants to talk about it. Bounty hunting, murder for hire, corporate espionage, smuggling, piracy, all of these and more are done by Astra Genesis every moment of every day throughough the known galaxy.

You are one of those Astra Genesis. But who were you *before* you becamse a furious Android Barbarian, or cunning Rogue?

> Game Designer: To be clear. Class only advances by Milestone. The Profession system ***COMPLETELY*** replaces the skill system in 5e. This system has some cross over. Your attribute modifier and your Proficiency modifer do play a role in your skills by giving you a greater margin for error in your rolls. 

Your profession is often separate from your Class. A class represents combat training. Your profession represents what your character did before they took on a role as a Starstrider. 

Put simply: Class comes into play in Ground Combat just following 5e rules. Profession comes into play outside combat more skill based (and also starship combat).

> Game Designer: If something says you get Advantage or Disadvantage you treat as normal and roll the dice twice taking the lwest or highest. If something says you get Expertise such as a Rogue you apply your Proficiency modifier twice as usual.
> 
> Jack of All Trades. Works exactly as it does in 5e. Normally you cannot add your proficiency modifier to skills with 0 Rating. With Jack of All Trades you can add half rounded down minimum 1
> 
> Reliable Talent. Slightly different. Instead of 10 you cannot roll lower than a 6. 

## Step 0: Intro
You will be getting some points to spend as you choose your profession. No skill can be higher than 5.

## Step 1: Your species
You already chose your species. You get a Trait from them in the name of the Species. More on this later. You also get a Trait the name of your class. So your starting Traits are Race/Class.

## Step 2: Backgrounds
Write down whatever label you want for your background. Fold it into your backstory. Were you Orphaned as a child? Put that in there and pick skills that make sense for an Orphaned Child. Work with your gamemaster. The removal of "Background Features" is replaced by the addition of a FEAT.

//TODO Write some Backgrounds

### Background Features
* Pick 1 Skill at +2
* Pick 3 Skills and add +1 to them
* Pick 1 Feat
* Pick 3 Focuses
* Create 2 Values

> Game Designer: What do 5th Edition backgrounds all have in common? No one cares. I have played 5th edition since its inception and DM'd over 2000 hours of it and I have almost never seen someone *use* their background feature. But feats like Lucky? Every day.

## Step 3: Professional Development
Profesional development represents what career your character had (and in some cases may still do). If there is not one that suits your character vision work with your gamemaster to make one. While there is not one for Rimworld Lawkeeper or a Computer Slicer, your gamemaster could definitely assist you in coming up with what that looks like.

- Spend 20 skills on your character
- Pick 3 Focuses
- Create 2 Values
- Gain 1 Contact or 1 Free Language

//TODO Write some Professions


## Heroism
Heroism is a currency in the Astra Genesis game. Each character starts every session with 2 Heroism. You are encouraged to use them. You can earn more in a session but at the end of the session any over the number of 2 are lost. 

### Spending Heroism
- Invoke a Trait or a Value of your own
- Invoke a Situation Trait or a Value of an NPC or a monster (if its known)
- Counter a Compel
- Declaring a Story Detail: "We planned for this!" 

### Earning Heorism
- PC's start with 2
- You can get more from Compels
- You can also buy (if you have zero) a Heroism by taking on a Complication.

## Traits
You typically have 2 of these (Species and Class). Occasionally you can get others like Rank or Position such as Starship Captain.

Traits are very broad Values. It covers the fact that you should know your language, history, and background of your species without needing to spend anything. It also covers situations where being a Species or a Specific class can be invoked either for your benefit or against you.

## Values
You have 4 of these.

A value is a core concept, or cornerstone of your character. In 5e these were Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws. They almost never serve a purpose so they are replaced in Astra Genesis with Values. Written as a guideline about your character they come into play using Heroism later. Values are neutral they can be for you and against you.  

## Invoking
Whenever you’re making a skill roll, and you’re in a situation where an value might be able to help you, you can spend a Heroism point to invoke it in order to change the dice result. This allows you to add 1d6 to your roll. You can do this before or after you’ve rolled the dice—if you aren’t happy with your total.

You also have to explain or justify how the value is helpful in order to get the bonus—sometimes it’ll be self-evident, and sometimes it might require some creative narrating.

You can spend multiple heorism on a roll to get an extra 1d6 for each point spent on the roll.

## Compels
Sometimes (in fact, probably often), you’ll find yourself in a situation where a value complicates your character’s life and creates unexpected drama. When that happens, the GM will suggest a potential complication that might arise. This is called a compel.

Sometimes, a compel means your character automatically fails at some goal, or your character’s choices are restricted, or simply that unintended consequences cloud whatever your character does. You might negotiate back and forth on the details a little, to arrive at what would be most appropriate and dramatic in the moment.

Once you’ve agreed to accept the complication, you get a Heroism point for your troubles. If you want, you can pay a Heroism point to prevent the complication from happening, but it is not recommended that you do that very often—you’ll probably need that Heroism point later, and getting compelled brings drama (and hence, fun) into your game’s story. If you do this that Heorism becomea Complication point for the GM (more on that later).

Players, you’re going to call for a compel when you want there to be a complication in a decision you’ve just made, if it’s related to one of your values. GMs, you’re going to call for a compel when you make the world respond to the characters in a complicated or dramatic way.

Anyone at the table is free to suggest when a compel might be appropriate for any character (including their own). GMs, you have the final word on whether or not a compel is valid. And speak up if you see that a compel happened naturally as a result of play, but no Heroism points were awarded.

| Untrained Skill  | 2d6 + ability score modifier + other modifiers                    |

> Game Designer: Why 2d6 and not 1d20? Because I want to. It allows for a more linear and truly controlled scale.

| 0      | Untrained, unskilled, lacking in innate aptitude                                                 |

| 3      | Experienced and well-trained, or an aptitude developed through study and training.               |
| 4      | Excellence within the field, achievable through dedication and experience.                       |
| 5      | Exceptional, often a combination of intense training, hard-won experience, and natural aptitude. |

## Focuses
You have 6 of these.

Each skill represents a somewhat broad area, a focus allows you to narrow that down and give a specific area that your character has knowledge in. Having an applicapble Focus for a skill check will provide you with Advantage to the roll if you already have Advantage this does not apply, if you have Disadvantage it counters that and makes the roll straight, alternatively also allows you to "Take 5" on the skill check when you are not in any danger or high stress treating it as though you rolled a 5 on 2d6 and add all your modifiers (this does not create Heroism). You can only Take 5 if you do not have disadvantage on the roll.

## Disciplines
The six disciplines (Phyiscal, Mental, Operational, Observational, Technical, and Social) represent very broad categories of education, training, and natural talent. Your rating in a Discipline is equal to the highest rating in a skill belonging to that Discipline. This comes up when you are trying something that does not fit the standard skills where you can use your natural aptitude for skills in that Discipline to help you carry you a bit. This is also helpful as the disciplines are not tied to a specific attribute and when used the GM will call for an Intellect + Social check or a Strength + Mental check; it just depends on which combination makes the most sense. **You do not get your proficiency modifier to Discipline checks**. You cannot use the Help action to use a Discipline on a check as per the 5e PHB you must be Proficient (have ratings) in the skill to use the Help Action.

## Progression
As your character levels you gain the following benefits.

- 1 Skill Point Per Level (up to 44 at 20th)
- You can swap out Focuses
- The additional benefits of leveling up in your class.
- **IF** you invoked or were compelled to use a Value during that level you can change Values or evolve them.

Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips

#### Appraise
You can appraise common or well-known objects.

- Simple. Trivial everyday objects such as china

#### Computer Use
You can operate, manipulate, and hack into computer systems. If you don’t have physical access to a computer system’s user interface, you must use a hacking kit to access and manipulate the system. .

Computers are set up to give one or more authorized users “root access,” allowing them to access any information or function of the computer as a standard action, with no need for a Computers check. Firewalls can block off specific sections of a computer and grant different users root access to those sections.

The base DC for many of the tasks of the Computers skill is equal to 8 + (2 × the computer’s tier). These DCs may be adjusted by the GM to reflect other circumstances.

- Simple. Write a simple program, access basic information. Hack into primitive computer or system.
- Routine. Write an average program; correlate related information; hack into a personal computer with a Security Level of 10
- Challenging. Write a complicated program; correlate unrelated information, hack into a specic starship system or other scure computer with a Security Level of 15
